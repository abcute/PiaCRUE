# PiaAGI: A Psycho-Cognitive Framework for Developing Artificial General Intelligence

## Introduction

The primary goal of the PiaAGI project is to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a psycho-cognitively plausible framework. This project emphasizes a cross-disciplinary approach, integrating insights and methodologies from psychology (including cognitive, developmental, personality, and social psychology), communication theory, Large Language Model (LLM) technology, and agent-based systems.

The core methodology of PiaAGI involves the development of "Personalized Intelligent Agents" (Pias). This is achieved through structured prompting and developmental scaffolding, a process detailed extensively in the cornerstone document, [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md).

## Project Vision & AGI Ambition

PiaAGI aims to make significant contributions to the AGI landscape by:

*   **Architecting AGI Systems:** Designing robust and adaptable cognitive architectures for AGI, as detailed in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#cognitive-architecture-of-pia) (Section 4).
*   **Fostering Deep Psychological Integration:** Embedding nuanced psychological principles into AI systems to create more human-like intelligence, drawing from [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#psychological-foundations-and-principles) (Section 3).
*   **Enabling Structured AGI Development:** Providing systematic methodologies for building and evolving AGI through structured prompting and developmental scaffolding, explained in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#pia-prompting-methodology) (Section 5) and [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#developmental-scaffolding-for-pia-growth) (Section 6).
*   **Promoting Ethical and Value-Aligned AGI:** Ensuring that AGI development is guided by ethical considerations and aligns with human values, with principles discussed in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#value-alignment-and-ethics) (e.g., Sections 3.1.3, 4.1.10).
*   **Facilitating Cross-Disciplinary AGI Research:** Creating a common ground and framework for researchers from diverse fields to collaborate on AGI development.
*   **Developing Practical Tools for AGI Research:** Offering a suite of software tools, including PiaSE (Pia Scripting Engine), PiaCML (Pia Communication & Messaging Language), PiaAVT (Pia Audio-Visual Toolkit), PiaPES (Pia Prompt Engineering System), and the Unified WebApp, to support the PiaAGI methodology.

## Target Audience

This project is relevant to a diverse group of professionals and researchers, including:

*   AGI Researchers
*   AI Developers
*   Psychologists (Cognitive, Developmental, Personality, Social)
*   Cognitive Scientists
*   AI Ethicists
*   Product Managers interested in advanced AI systems

## Quick Start / Navigating This Repository

1.  **Start with the Cornerstone:** Begin by reading [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md). This document lays out the theoretical foundations, methodologies, and overarching vision of the PiaAGI project.
2.  **Understand Repository Structure:** Consult [`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`](PROJECT_GUIDE.md) for a detailed map of the repository, its directories, and file organization.
3.  **Explore AGI-centric Examples:** Review the foundational examples provided in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#application-examples-and-use-cases) (Section 7) and [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#appendix-a-pia-foundational-prompt-examples) (Appendix A) to understand practical implementations.
4.  **Discover the Tool Suite:** Navigate to the [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/) directory and its [`README.md`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/README.md) for an overview of PiaSE, PiaCML, PiaAVT, PiaPES, and the Unified WebApp. Note that these tools are currently in their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage.

## Core Components

*   **[`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md):** The central document detailing the PiaAGI framework, psychological principles, cognitive architecture, prompting methodology, and developmental scaffolding.
*   **[`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/):** Contains the suite of software tools developed to support PiaAGI research. See its [README.md](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/README.md) for more information.
*   **[`Papers/`](Papers/):** A collection of research papers, articles, and pre-prints related to the PiaAGI project and its underlying concepts.
*   **[`Examples/`](Examples/):** Provides practical examples and use cases demonstrating the application of the PiaAGI framework and tools.

## WebApp Guidance

The [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/) directory hosts the Unified WebApp, designed to provide an interactive interface for PiaAGI experimentation. For detailed setup instructions, LLM API key configuration, and usage, please refer to the [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/README.md`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/README.md).

## Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

The PiaAGI project is modular. Individual tools such as `PiaSE`, `PiaAVT`, `PiaPES`, and the `WebApp` each have their own `requirements.txt` file located within their respective directories (e.g., `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaSE/requirements.txt`). Users should consult these specific files for the dependencies required by each component.
