# PiaAGI: A Psycho-Cognitive Framework for Developing Artificial General Intelligence

## Introduction

As the architect of the PiaAGI project, I introduce this advanced, cross-disciplinary framework dedicated to the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The PiaAGI framework is founded on a psycho-cognitively plausible architecture—a core design philosophy I've instituted to guide our approach. It strategically integrates insights and methodologies from psychology (cognitive, developmental, personality, and social), communication theory, Large Language Model (LLM) technology, and agent-based systems.

The core methodology I've designed for PiaAGI centers on the development of "Personalized Intelligent Agents" (Pias). This is achieved through a robust system of structured prompting and developmental scaffolding, processes detailed extensively in the cornerstone document I authored, [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md).

## Project Vision & AGI Ambition

My blueprint within PiaAGI offers a robust theoretical and practical path toward AGI, making significant and lasting contributions to the field. This project is resolutely dedicated to:

*   **Architecting AGI Systems:** Delivering powerful and adaptable cognitive architectures for AGI, as articulated in my design document, [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#cognitive-architecture-of-pia) (Section 4).
*   **Fostering Deep Psychological Integration:** Embedding sophisticated psychological principles into AI systems to cultivate more human-like intelligence, drawing from the foundational work detailed in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#psychological-foundations-and-principles) (Section 3).
*   **Enabling Structured AGI Development:** Furnishing systematic and effective methodologies for building and evolving AGI. This is achieved through the structured prompting and developmental scaffolding techniques I've developed, explained in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#pia-prompting-methodology) (Section 5) and [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#developmental-scaffolding-for-pia-growth) (Section 6).
*   **Promoting Ethical and Value-Aligned AGI:** Ensuring AGI development is rigorously guided by ethical considerations and intrinsically aligned with human values, with principles I've embedded throughout [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#value-alignment-and-ethics) (e.g., Sections 3.1.3, 4.1.10).
*   **Facilitating Cross-Disciplinary AGI Research:** Establishing a unifying common ground and a clear framework that empowers researchers from diverse fields to collaborate effectively on AGI development.
*   **Developing Practical Tools for AGI Research:** Providing a comprehensive suite of software tools—PiaSE (Pia Scripting Engine), PiaCML (Pia Communication & Messaging Language), PiaAVT (Pia Audio-Visual Toolkit), PiaPES (Pia Prompt Engineering System), and the Unified WebApp—all designed to fully support and implement the PiaAGI methodology.

## Target Audience

This project is highly relevant to a diverse group of professionals and researchers committed to advancing AI, including:

*   AGI Researchers
*   AI Developers
*   Psychologists (Cognitive, Developmental, Personality, Social)
*   Cognitive Scientists
*   AI Ethicists
*   Product Managers focused on pioneering advanced AI systems

## Quick Start / Navigating This Repository

1.  **Start with the Cornerstone:** Begin by thoroughly reading [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md). This document articulates the theoretical foundations, methodologies, and the definitive vision of the PiaAGI project.
2.  **Understand Repository Structure:** Consult [`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`](PROJECT_GUIDE.md) for a detailed map of the repository, its directories, and file organization.
3.  **Explore AGI-centric Examples:** Review the foundational examples provided in [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#application-examples-and-use-cases) (Section 7) and [`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md#appendix-a-pia-foundational-prompt-examples) (Appendix A) to understand practical applications of the framework.
4.  **Discover the Tool Suite:** Navigate to the [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/) directory and its [`README.md`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/README.md) for an overview of PiaSE, PiaCML, PiaAVT, PiaPES, and the Unified WebApp. Note that these tools are currently in their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage but are rapidly evolving.

## Core Components

*   **[`PiaAGI.md`](PiaAGI.md):** The central document I authored, detailing the PiaAGI framework, its psychological principles, cognitive architecture, prompting methodology, and developmental scaffolding.
*   **[`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/):** Contains the suite of software tools specifically developed to support and implement PiaAGI research. See its [README.md](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/README.md) for more information.
*   **[`Papers/`](Papers/):** A collection of research papers, articles, and pre-prints related to the PiaAGI project and its underlying concepts, including foundational work that has informed this framework.
*   **[`Examples/`](Examples/):** Provides practical examples and use cases demonstrating the application of the PiaAGI framework and its associated tools.

## WebApp Guidance

The [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/) directory hosts the Unified WebApp, designed to provide an interactive interface for PiaAGI experimentation. For detailed setup instructions, LLM API key configuration, and usage, please refer to the [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/README.md`](PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/README.md).

## Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

The PiaAGI project is modular by design. Individual tools such as `PiaSE`, `PiaAVT`, `PiaPES`, and the `WebApp` each have their own `requirements.txt` file located within their respective directories (e.g., `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaSE/requirements.txt`). Users should consult these specific files for the dependencies required by each component.
