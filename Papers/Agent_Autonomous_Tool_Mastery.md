# Autonomous Tool Design, Creation, and Use: A Core Tenet for Digital Human-like Agents

**Hypothetical Source:** A foundational concept within the PiaAGI Framework (Conceptualized 2024).
*Note: This document outlines a core theoretical viewpoint of the PiaAGI project: the capacity for autonomous tool design, creation, and utilization is a fundamental characteristic of human-level general intelligence. Therefore, agents aspiring to AGI, conceptualized as "digital humans," must inherently possess this capability.*

## Abstract

A defining characteristic that distinguishes human intelligence is the sophisticated and autonomous ability to design, fabricate, and utilize tools to solve novel problems and adapt to diverse environments. This paper posits that for an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) agent to achieve true human-like general intelligence, as explored within the PiaAGI framework, it must transcend being merely a user of pre-defined tools and become an autonomous tool-crafter. We argue that an agent's innate programming, scripting, and algorithmic composition capabilities, when provided with a sufficiently expressive and sandboxed execution environment (such as a virtual machine), form the fundamental basis for such autonomous tool design, creation, and application. This perspective frames the agent's ability to programmatically extend its own functionalities as a core pathway to genuine problem-solving autonomy, adaptive behavior, and the emergence of increasingly complex capabilities, mirroring a key aspect of human cognitive and technological evolution. This tenet suggests that the journey towards AGI is inextricably linked to empowering agents to become masters of their own digital toolkits.
