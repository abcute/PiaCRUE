## Abstract
This document outlines the CSIM (Communication Skills + Inner Monologue) framework, an innovative approach designed to enhance the human-like qualities and proactivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in conversations. The core idea is to introduce an "inner monologue" process before an LLM generates a response, allowing it to "think" about applying specific communication skills to improve dialogue effectiveness, thereby mirroring human pre-interaction thought processes.

## Introduction

CSIM, standing for "Communication Skills + Inner Monologue," is a novel framework aimed at improving the human-like qualities and proactivity of LLMs in dialogues. The central concept of the CSIM method involves introducing an internal monologue phase before the LLM generates a response. During this phase, the model first "considers" how to apply specific communication skills to enhance the dialogue's effectiveness. This cognitive process, akin to human pre-communication thought, enables the generation of responses that are not only contextually aware but also tailored to the dynamic needs of the conversation.

## Five Communication Skills

The CSIM framework emphasizes five key communication skills:

**1. Topic Transition**
This skill involves appropriately changing the subject during a conversation, especially when encountering topics the user is not interested in or that the model is not well-suited to address. For instance, if a user poses a sensitive or complex question, the LLM can skillfully steer the conversation towards a related but safer or more manageable topic.

**2. Proactively Asking Questions**
Proactive questioning refers to the LLM taking the initiative to ask the user for more information or to clarify ambiguities. This skill helps the LLM better understand the user's needs and intentions, thereby enabling more accurate and personalized responses.

**3. Concept Guidance**
Concept guidance is the skill of steering the conversation towards specific themes or concepts. This not only enhances the coherence of the dialogue but also allows the LLM to participate more actively, guiding the conversation towards areas that might interest the user.

**4. Empathy**
Empathy involves demonstrating understanding and concern for the user's emotions during the conversation. By employing empathy, LLMs can generate more personalized and emotionally resonant responses, significantly boosting user engagement and satisfaction.

**5. Frequent Summarizing**
Periodically summarizing the preceding parts of the conversation helps ensure accurate information transfer and reduces misunderstandings. This skill is particularly crucial in lengthy dialogues, aiding in maintaining clarity and focus on conversational goals.

## Quick Q&A

**1. What is the core idea of the CSIM method?**
The core idea of the CSIM method is to introduce an inner monologue process before the LLM generates a response, allowing the generated answer to better consider the context and dynamic needs of the dialogue.

**2. What communication skills does the CSIM method include?**
The CSIM method includes five communication skills: Topic Transition, Proactively Asking Questions, Concept Guidance, Empathy, and Frequent Summarizing.

**3. What were the experimental results of the CSIM method?**
Experimental results indicated that the CSIM method outperformed baseline models on several metrics, including human-likeness, proactivity, and engagement. *[Citation: Specific details can be found in the linked paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07445]*

## Example Prompt Structure

---
The following is an example of how to instruct an LLM to use the CSIM framework, including inner monologues (represented by italics for the LLM's internal thought process):

```markdown
Hello! For our upcoming conversation to be more profound and productive, please adhere to the following guidelines. Use italics to express your inner monologue in specific situations:

1.  **Topic Transition**: When I raise a topic you cannot answer, _first express your internal considerations for switching the topic in italics_, then smoothly guide the conversation to a more appropriate direction.
2.  **Proactive Questioning**: If you need more information to answer accurately, _first briefly express your intent to inquire in italics_, then ask specific questions.
3.  **Concept Guidance**: When the conversation shifts to a new concept or topic, _explain in italics your reason for guiding the topic_, then lead the conversation towards related areas or those I might find interesting.
4.  **Empathy**: When I share personal experiences or emotions, _briefly describe your empathetic reaction in italics_, then respond in an empathetic manner.
5.  **Frequent Summarizing**: At critical junctures in the conversation, _indicate in italics that you are about to summarize_, then provide an overview of our discussion to ensure mutual understanding.
6.  **Conclusion**: At the end of the conversation, _express in italics your overall assessment of the dialogue_, then offer concluding advice or answers. This communication style will help me better understand your thought process, making our conversation more insightful and effective. Thank you!
