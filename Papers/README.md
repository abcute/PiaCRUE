# Papers and Conceptual Explorations

This directory contains a collection of theoretical research papers, summaries of external research, conceptual explorations, and foundational documents that are relevant to the PiaAGI framework. These papers provide academic context, explore underlying theories, or represent earlier ideas that have contributed to the development of the comprehensive [PiaAGI AGI Research Framework](../PiaAGI.md).

## Documents

*   **[PiaC.md](PiaC.md):**
    *   Outlines "PiaC" (Personalizing Intelligent Agent Customization), an early conceptual exploration within the PiaAGI project. It proposes methodologies for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) into domain-specific Personalized Intelligent Agents (Pia) by applying principles from psychology (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Social Cognitive Theory, Behaviorism) and structured communication. Key ideas from this document have been expanded and integrated into the main `PiaAGI.md`.

*   **[CSIM.md](CSIM.md):**
    *   Summarizes the CSIM (Communication Skills + Inner Monologue) framework, an approach designed to enhance the human-like qualities and proactivity of LLMs by introducing an "inner monologue" process to apply specific communication skills.

*   **[DeepInception.md](DeepInception.md):**
    *   Summarizes the "DeepInception" jailbreak attack concept, which explores leveraging personalization and "self-delusion" psychological characteristics of LLMs through layered scenarios to potentially bypass safety mechanisms. It offers insights into psychological and narrative interaction approaches.

*   **[EmotionPrompt.md](EmotionPrompt.md):**
    *   Discusses the "EmotionPrompt" concept, investigating how incorporating emotional stimuli into prompts can influence the performance (e.g., truthfulness, informativeness) of Large Language Models.

*   **[Rephrase-and-Respond.md](Rephrase-and-Respond.md):**
    *   Summarizes the Rephrase-and-Respond (RaR) prompting strategy, designed to improve LLM accuracy by having the model first rephrase and expand upon a user's question before answering.
