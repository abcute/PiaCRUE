<!-- PiaAGI AGI Research Framework Document -->
# Papers and Conceptual Explorations

This directory contains a collection of theoretical research papers, summaries of external research, conceptual explorations, and foundational documents that are relevant to the PiaAGI framework. These papers provide academic context, explore underlying theories, or represent earlier ideas that have contributed to the development of the comprehensive [PiaAGI AGI Research Framework](../PiaAGI.md).

## Documents

*   **[AGI_Interdisciplinary_Memorandum.md](AGI_Interdisciplinary_Memorandum.md):**
    *   Provides a memorandum outlining various academic disciplines relevant to AGI development, serving as a reference for interdisciplinary insights for the PiaAGI framework.

*   **[Agent_Autonomous_Tool_Mastery.md](Agent_Autonomous_Tool_Mastery.md):** (PiaAGI Core Concept)
    *   Outlines the core PiaAGI viewpoint that an AGI agent, akin to a "digital human," must possess the capability for autonomous tool design, creation, and use, leveraging its programming abilities as a foundational mechanism for this.

*   **[AI_Cultural_Evolution.md](AI_Cultural_Evolution.md):** (Hypothetical)
    *   Explores the integration of cultural evolution theories (variation, selection, transmission of cultural traits) into AI agent development, particularly for multi-agent systems and LLMs, aiming for AI that can participate in and adapt to simulated cultural dynamics.

*   **[AI_Ethical_Heuristics.md](AI_Ethical_Heuristics.md):** (Hypothetical)
    *   Investigates integrating ethical heuristics from social psychology (e.g., Moral Foundations Theory, fairness principles) into AI decision-making to foster more nuanced and human-relatable ethical reasoning.

*   **[AI_Narrative_Understanding.md](AI_Narrative_Understanding.md):** (Hypothetical)
    *   Proposes a framework on the role of narrative and storytelling in enhancing human-AI understanding, examining how AI (especially LLMs) might develop deeper contextual awareness and worldviews through narrative processing.

*   **[Alita_Agent.md](Alita_Agent.md):**
    *   Summarizes the Alita agent framework (arXiv:2505.20286), which emphasizes "Minimal Predefinition" and "Maximal Self-Evolution" through dynamic generation and reuse of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) for scalable agentic reasoning.

*   **[Architectural_Maturation_Framework.md](Architectural_Maturation_Framework.md):** (PiaAGI Foundational Concept)
    *   Outlines a conceptual framework for how a PiaAGI agent's underlying cognitive architecture might evolve its capacities and efficiencies over time.

*   **[Chain_of_Thought_Alignment.md](Chain_of_Thought_Alignment.md):** (PiaAGI Conceptual Linking)
    *   Explores Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting as embodying the PiaAGI principle of interacting with agents as human-like thinkers capable of step-by-step cognitive processes.

*   **[Computational_Models_Motivation.md](Computational_Models_Motivation.md):** (PiaAGI Foundational Concept)
    *   Provides high-level computational model outlines for intrinsic motivations like Curiosity and Competence, expanding on the `Motivational_System_Specification.md`.

*   **[CSIM.md](CSIM.md):**
    *   Summarizes the CSIM (Communication Skills + Inner Monologue) framework, an approach designed to enhance the human-like qualities and proactivity of LLMs by introducing an "inner monologue" process to apply specific communication skills.

*   **[DeepInception.md](DeepInception.md):**
    *   Summarizes the "DeepInception" jailbreak attack concept, which explores leveraging personalization and "self-delusion" psychological characteristics of LLMs through layered scenarios to potentially bypass safety mechanisms. It offers insights into psychological and narrative interaction approaches.

*   **[EmotionPrompt.md](EmotionPrompt.md):**
    *   Discusses the "EmotionPrompt" concept, investigating how incorporating emotional stimuli into prompts can influence the performance (e.g., truthfulness, informativeness) of Large Language Models.

*   **[Human_Inspired_Agent_Blueprint.md](Human_Inspired_Agent_Blueprint.md):** (PiaAGI Foundational Concept)
    *   Provides a mind map-like overview of multidisciplinary inspirations (biology, cognitive science, anthropology, sociology, psychology) for constructing various facets of human-like agents.

*   **[PAPER_TEMPLATE.md](PAPER_TEMPLATE.md):**
    *   A template for creating new conceptual papers within the PiaAGI project, ensuring a consistent structure.

*   **[PiaC.md](PiaC.md):**
    *   Outlines "PiaC" (Personalizing Intelligent Agent Customization), an early conceptual exploration within the PiaAGI project. It proposes methodologies for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) into domain-specific Personalized Intelligent Agents (Pia) by applying principles from psychology (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Social Cognitive Theory, Behaviorism) and structured communication. Key ideas from this document have been expanded and integrated into the main `PiaAGI.md`.

*   **[Python_Cognitive_Architecture_Libraries_Survey.md](Python_Cognitive_Architecture_Libraries_Survey.md):**
    *   Surveys existing Python libraries that could be relevant for implementing aspects of the PiaAGI cognitive architecture, such as probabilistic reasoning, knowledge graphs, and symbolic AI.

*   **[Rephrase-and-Respond.md](Rephrase-and-Respond.md):**
    *   Summarizes the Rephrase-and-Respond (RaR) prompting strategy, designed to improve LLM accuracy by having the model first rephrase and expand upon a user's question before answering.

*   **[RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md](RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md):** (PiaAGI Project Planning)
    *   Outlines specific, achievable research and conceptual development goals for the PiaAGI project for the near term (e.g., 6-12 months).

*   **[Research_Plan_ToM_Scaffolding.md](Research_Plan_ToM_Scaffolding.md):** (PiaAGI Research Plan)
    *   Details a research plan for designing and conceptually evaluating a developmental scaffolding curriculum for Theory of Mind (ToM) acquisition in early-stage PiaAGI agents.
