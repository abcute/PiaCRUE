# A Blueprint for Human-Inspired Agent Construction: Multidisciplinary Perspectives

**Context:** A conceptual document within the PiaAGI Framework (Conceptualized 2024).
*Note: This document outlines a mind map-like structure of inspirations and ideas for constructing advanced, human-like AI agents. It draws from diverse fields including biology, cognitive science, anthropology, sociology, and psychology to enrich the theoretical foundations of PiaAGI. The core premise is that by understanding the multifaceted nature of human beings and human societies, we can better design agents that exhibit general intelligence and nuanced interaction capabilities.*
