## Introduction

This document outlines specific, achievable research and conceptual development goals for the PiaAGI project over the next 6-12 months. These goals are designed to leverage the existing PiaAGI framework, the Cognitive Module Library (CML), the PiaPES toolkit, and conceptual applications of PiaAVT, while adhering to any operational constraints (such as avoiding direct modifications to the PiaSE codebase if specified). The focus is on deepening the theoretical underpinnings and practical design specifications of key AGI capabilities within PiaAGI.

## Near-Term Research & Development Goals

### 1. Goal: Elaboration of the `EthicalFramework` within the Self-Model Module

*   **Context:** The `EthicalFramework` is a critical component of the Self-Model, responsible for guiding the agent's behavior according to programmed and learned values. Current implementations are foundational.
*   **Research Question:** How can the `EthicalFramework` (as specified in `Self_Model_Module_Specification.md` and `PiaAGI.md`) be computationally detailed to allow for:
    *   Dynamic learning and refinement of ethical principles from experience and feedback?
    *   Effective and justifiable resolution of conflicts between different ethical values or principles?
*   **Development Target (Conceptual):**
    1.  Develop detailed pseudo-code or formal algorithms for at least two core mechanisms within the `EthicalFramework`:
        *   A mechanism for updating `learned_ethical_principles` based on feedback from simulated interactions (interactions designed via PiaPES, outcomes logged via `PiaLogger`, and conceptually analyzed as if by PiaAVT). This should consider how feedback (positive/negative reinforcement, explicit correction) modifies the strength, applicability, or content of principles.
        *   A mechanism for applying a `value_conflict_resolution_strategy` when two or more ethical principles suggest contradictory actions. This should involve identifying the conflict, referencing stored strategies (e.g., prioritization, seeking clarification, defaulting to least harm), and selecting an approach.
    2.  Document how these mechanisms would interact with the `check_ethical_consistency` method of the Self-Model.
*   **Tools & Modules Leveraged:**
    *   PiaPES: For designing hypothetical scenarios and Guiding Prompts that pose ethical dilemmas or provide ethical feedback.
    *   CML: `ConcreteSelfModelModule` (conceptual interaction with its `EthicalFramework` data structure), `ConcreteLearningModule` (conceptual mechanisms for updating ethical principles).
    *   `PiaLogger`: To define the log data that would be necessary to capture for such learning and decision-making.
    *   PiaAVT: Conceptual analysis of logged ethical decision outcomes and learning progression.
*   **Success Metric:** A whitepaper or a new detailed section within `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaCML/Self_Model_Module_Specification.md` (or a dedicated new paper in `Papers/`) describing these computational mechanisms, illustrated with examples.

### 2. Goal: Designing a Foundational "PiaSeedling" Developmental Curriculum

*   **Context:** PiaAGI posits development through stages. A concrete curriculum for the initial "PiaSeedling" stage is needed to make this concept operational.
*   **Research Question:** What is a minimal yet effective set of interactive experiences and agent configurations (definable via PiaPES) required to guide a PiaAGI agent from a nascent state to achieving core PiaSeedling milestones (e.g., basic environmental interaction, simple rule-following, rudimentary Self-Model awareness of its own actions, basic interaction with conceptual proto-tools as per `PiaAGI.md` Section 3.2.1)?
*   **Development Target (PiaPES Artifacts & Documentation):**
    1.  Define 3-5 specific, measurable PiaSeedling milestones based on `PiaAGI.md`.
    2.  Design a `DevelopmentalCurriculum` using PiaPES's `DevelopmentalCurriculum` and `CurriculumStep` classes. This involves creating the necessary `PiaAGIPrompt` JSON templates for each step, including role definitions and cognitive configurations suitable for a PiaSeedling.
    3.  For each `CurriculumStep`, document:
        *   The specific learning objective tied to a PiaSeedling milestone.
        *   The `entry_conditions` and `success_criteria` (conceptually, how these would be assessed, e.g., via PiaAVT analysis of logs from a PiaSE run).
        *   The expected agent behaviors and internal state changes.
*   **Tools & Modules Leveraged:**
    *   PiaPES: Primary tool for designing the curriculum structure and individual step prompts.
    *   CML: The `PiaAGIPrompt`s will configure CML modules (e.g., basic `ConcreteSelfModelModule`, `ConcreteWorkingMemoryModule`, `ConcretePerceptionModule`, `ConcreteBehaviorGenerationModule`).
    *   PiaAVT: Conceptual definition of metrics that would be used to evaluate milestone achievement.
*   **Success Metric:**
    *   A complete `DevelopmentalCurriculum` JSON file (e.g., `PiaSeedling_Core_Curriculum_v1.json`) stored in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/examples/curricula/`.
    *   A companion markdown document (e.g., in `Examples/Developmental_Scaffolding/`) explaining the curriculum's rationale, structure, steps, and expected outcomes.

### 3. Goal: Specifying Data Flow and Interaction Logic between Motivational System and Planning Module

*   **Context:** The interplay between motivation (goal generation) and planning (achieving goals) is fundamental. The specifics of how these CML modules communicate need further detailing.
*   **Research Question:** How do intrinsic and extrinsic goals generated by the `ConcreteMotivationalSystemModule` (e.g., goal objects with properties like `goal_id`, `type`, `priority`, `description`, `status`) translate into concrete, actionable inputs that the `ConcretePlanningAndDecisionMakingModule` can effectively use to generate, evaluate, and select plans, especially when multiple goals might be active or conflicting?
*   **Development Target (Conceptual Design & CML Documentation):**
    1.  Define the precise data structures (e.g., Python TypedDicts or Pydantic models in documentation) for "goal packets" passed from Motivation to Planning.
    2.  Specify how the Planning module ingests these goal packets and uses them in its `create_plan` and `evaluate_plan` methods (e.g., how goal priority influences plan search or evaluation scores).
    3.  Document at least two detailed strategies (e.g., algorithm outlines or flowcharts) for how the Planning module (or a Central Executive component orchestrating them) could handle conflicting goals received from the Motivational System. Examples:
        *   Prioritization: Strict execution based on goal priority.
        *   Interleaving: Time-slicing or alternating steps towards different goals.
        *   Goal Subsumption/Transformation: Identifying if one goal can be a sub-goal of another, or if a new compromise goal can be formulated.
    4.  Update `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaCML/Motivational_System_Specification.md` and create/update a similar specification document for the Planning module, detailing this interface and interaction logic.
*   **Tools & Modules Leveraged:**
    *   CML: `ConcreteMotivationalSystemModule`, `ConcretePlanningAndDecisionMakingModule` (focus on their Python interfaces and how they'd be called, e.g., via the WebApp backend).
*   **Success Metric:** Updated/new CML module specification documents clearly detailing the Motivation-Planning interface, data structures, and conflict resolution strategies.

### 4. Goal: Conceptualizing "Architectural Maturation" Triggers for Working Memory

*   **Context:** `PiaAGI.md` (Section 3.2.1) introduces "Architectural Maturation," where an agent's cognitive architecture itself can evolve. This needs more concrete thought for specific modules.
*   **Research Question:** What specific, observable performance metrics or internal agent states (which could be logged by `PiaLogger` and analyzed by PiaAVT) could act as reliable triggers for initiating a conceptual "architectural maturation" process for the `ConcreteWorkingMemoryModule`? Examples of maturation could include increasing its `_capacity` or refining its `manage_workspace_capacity_and_coherence` strategy.
*   **Development Target (Conceptual Paper / Documentation):**
    1.  Propose 2-3 specific, quantitatively definable metrics related to Working Memory performance or state. Examples:
        *   Sustained high cognitive load (e.g., `get_cognitive_load()` consistently > 0.9 for X period).
        *   Frequency of "error_workspace_full" returns from `ConcreteWorkingMemoryModule.store()` over a period.
        *   Patterns of repeated task failures (logged via `PiaLogger` from Planning/Execution) correlated with high WM item churn or specific WM content limitations.
    2.  Describe how the `ConcreteSelfModelModule` could conceptually monitor these metrics (requiring these metrics to be part of the `PiaLogger` output that PiaAVT can process and SelfModel can theoretically access).
    3.  Outline a decision-making process within the Self-Model (conceptual algorithm) that would evaluate these metrics against thresholds or patterns to trigger a "maturation event" for Working Memory.
    4.  Document these proposals in `Papers/Architectural_Maturation_Framework.md` (created in a previous plan step, or create if not existing) or a dedicated new paper.
*   **Tools & Modules Leveraged:**
    *   CML: `ConcreteWorkingMemoryModule` (its current methods and potential metrics), `ConcreteSelfModelModule` (its conceptual role in monitoring and triggering).
    *   `PiaLogger` & PiaAVT: For defining what data would need to be logged and how it might be analyzed to derive the trigger metrics.
*   **Success Metric:** A documented proposal (e.g., a chapter in `Architectural_Maturation_Framework.md`) outlining specific WM performance/state metrics, their monitoring by the Self-Model, and the conceptual decision process for triggering WM maturation.
