# PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT) is designed to provide researchers and developers with a comprehensive suite of tools to log, analyze, understand, and visualize the behavior, internal cognitive states, learning trajectories, and developmental progress of PiaAGI agents.

**Goals:**
*   **Deepen Understanding of AGI Behavior:** Enable researchers to go beyond observing input-output behavior and gain insights into the internal workings of PiaAGI agents.
*   **Evaluate Cognitive Module Performance:** Provide tools to assess the functioning and effectiveness of individual cognitive modules (from PiaCML) and their interactions within an agent.
*   **Track Learning and Development:** Allow for the longitudinal analysis of agent learning, adaptation, and progression through developmental stages (Section 3.2.1 of `PiaAGI.md`).
*   **Debug and Refine Agents:** Help developers identify bottlenecks, unintended behaviors, and areas for improvement in PiaAGI agent configurations.
*   **Facilitate Explainable AI (XAI):** Support the generation of explanations for agent decisions and actions by visualizing internal reasoning paths and state changes (linking to Self-Model outputs, Section 4.1.10 of `PiaAGI.md`).
*   **Compare Agent Performance:** Enable quantitative and qualitative comparison of different PiaAGI agent versions or configurations under various conditions.
*   **Support Scientific Communication:** Provide tools for generating visualizations and summary statistics suitable for research publications and presentations.

*   **Learning Trajectory Analysis:**
    *   Plot learning curves for various skills and knowledge domains.
    *   Analyze changes in module parameters or LTM content over time.
    *   Tools for identifying learning plateaus, catastrophic forgetting events, or successful transfer learning.
*   **Developmental Stage Assessment:**
    *   Metrics and visualizations to help assess an agent's current developmental stage based on its manifested capabilities (linking to Section 3.2.1 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Comparison of agent behavior against expected milestones for each stage.

    *   Allow users to query logged data for specific events, states, or patterns.
    *   Filter data based on time, module, agent, or experimental condition.

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE):** PiaAVT is the primary consumer of logs generated by PiaSE. It will analyze agent-environment interactions, task performance, and events occurring within the simulation.
*   **Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML):** PiaAVT will analyze logs generated directly by PiaCML modules, providing insights into their internal states, processing dynamics, and learning progress. For example, visualizing the changing structure of a Semantic LTM graph or the activation patterns in a WM module.
*   **PiaAGI Agents:** PiaAVT helps visualize and understand the holistic behavior emerging from the interaction of modules within a complete PiaAGI agent.
*   **PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES):** PiaAVT can help evaluate the effectiveness of prompts and developmental scaffolding designed with PiaPES by analyzing the resulting agent behavior and developmental trajectories. For instance, comparing learning curves of agents trained with different scaffolding strategies.
*   **Developmental Stages (Section 3.2.1 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaAVT will provide tools to track an agent's progress against the defined developmental stages, visualizing the acquisition of milestone capabilities.
*   **Ethical Framework Analysis:** PiaAVT can be used to trace how ethical principles within the Self-Model (4.1.10) influence decision-making in the Planning Module (4.1.8), particularly when analyzing logs from ethical dilemma scenarios.

PiaAVT will be indispensable for making the complex internal dynamics of PiaAGI agents transparent, understandable, and amenable to scientific inquiry and iterative improvement.
