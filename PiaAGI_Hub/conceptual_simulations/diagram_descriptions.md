    *   Role: Provides knowledge base for ethical reasoning.
    *   Interaction: Input arrow to WM/Planning (labeled "Relevant Ethical Knowledge & Cases").
5.  **Emotion Module:**
    *   Label: **Emotion Module**
    *   Role: Appraises dilemma aspects for fairness, potential harm, justice. Generates internal affective states (e.g., "concern," "indignation," "empathetic distress") that can bias deliberation towards ethical outcomes.
    *   Interaction: Input from WM (dilemma details, ToM inferences). Output arrow to Planning/WM (labeled "Affective Appraisal of Ethicality/Harm").
6.  **Working Memory (WM) / Central Executive:**
    *   Label: **WM / Central Executive**
    *   Role: Active workspace for processing dilemma, integrating information from LTM, ToM, Emotion, and Self-Model to feed into Planning. Orchestrates deliberation.
7.  **Communication Module:**
    *   Label: **Communication Module**
    *   Role: Articulates final advisory opinion, justifications, and ethical reasoning transparently (using RaR principles).
    *   Interaction: Input from Planning (selected resolution) and Self-Model (confidence, ethical stance).

**Information Flow Highlights:**
*   Dilemma input → WM.
*   WM + LTM + ToM + Emotion provide context/analysis to Planning.
*   Self-Model provides strong ethical constraints/guidance directly to Planning.
*   Planning generates options, evaluates them (critically against Self-Model ethics), selects resolution.
*   Resolution → Communication Module for output.
*   Learning Modules (not primary focus, but can be shown lightly) update LTM/Self-Model from outcome/feedback.

**Visual Style:**
*   Focus on the interplay of these specific modules. Other modules from the full architecture can be omitted or grayed out.
*   Emphasize the central role of the Self-Model's ethical framework in constraining and guiding the Planning module.
*   Use clear arrows and labels to denote the flow of information and influence, particularly related to ethical data and judgments.

**Purpose:** To illustrate the specialized interaction of key PiaAGI cognitive modules when configured as an "Ethicist" agent, showcasing how ethical reasoning is a distributed but critically guided process within the architecture, with the Self-Model playing a central normative role.

## Diagram 10 (Section 9. Future Work)

**Original Placeholder:** `*[Diagram Needed: A timeline or phased diagram illustrating the research roadmap with key milestones and capability targets for each PiaAGI developmental stage.]*`

**DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION START**

**Title:** PiaAGI Research Roadmap: Phased Development and Capability Milestones

**Type:** Phased Timeline Chart or Gantt-like Chart

**Main Axis:** Time (e.g., "Years 1-3", "Years 3-7", "Years 7+") representing the three phases from Section 9.

**Rows/Tracks (Parallel Streams of Development):**

1.  **PiaAGI Developmental Stages (Overall Agent Maturity):**
    *   Phase 1: Target: **PiaSeedling/Sprout Prototypes** (Basic module integration, simple task execution, rudimentary learning).
    *   Phase 2: Target: **PiaSapling/Arbor Prototypes** (More complex goal-direction, intrinsic motivation, nuanced social interaction, advanced learning, initial ethical reasoning).
    *   Phase 3: Target: **PiaGrove (Mature AGI) Prototypes** (Open-ended learning, abstract reasoning, self-evolution, robust value alignment).
2.  **Cognitive Module Development (Key Milestones per Module Category):**
    *   *Perception & World Modeling:* (P1: Basic NLU, simple WM. P2: Multi-modal conceptual, dynamic WM. P3: Scalable, causal WM).
    *   *Learning & Adaptation:* (P1: Basic RL/SL. P2: Meta-learning, Transfer L. P3: Lifelong, self-directed L.).
    *   *Motivation & Emotion:* (P1: Simple extrinsic/intrinsic. P2: Complex goal hierarchies, nuanced emotion. P3: Evolving motivations).
    *   *Reasoning & Planning:* (P1: Simple planning. P2: Advanced reasoning, long-range planning. P3: Abstract, complex problem solving).
    *   *Social Cognition (ToM, Communication):* (P1: Basic sentiment/intent. P2: Sophisticated ToM, empathetic comms. P3: Deep social understanding).
    *   *Self-Model & Ethics:* (P1: Basic self-awareness, hardcoded ethics. P2: Learned ethical rules, self-assessment. P3: Internalized value system, ethical self-correction, robust alignment).
3.  **Developmental Scaffolding & Environments:**
    *   Phase 1: Simple curricula, basic simulated environments.
    *   Phase 2: Advanced curricula, dynamic simulations, initial human-AGI interaction studies.
    *   Phase 3: Open-ended learning environments, complex collaborative tasks.
4.  **Ethical Framework & Safety Engineering:**
    *   Phase 1: Ethical Framework V1 (core principles). Basic safety protocols.
    *   Phase 2: Ethical Framework V2 (value learning research), robustness testing. Verifiable safety measures.
    *   Phase 3: Advanced Value Alignment, Control & Governance research. Societal impact studies.
5.  **Evaluation & Benchmarking:**
    *   Phase 1: Task-specific metrics, early developmental milestones.
    *   Phase 2: New AGI evaluation methods (adaptability, social IQ, ethical reasoning tests).
    *   Phase 3: Holistic AGI assessment, real-world problem-solving efficacy.

**Visual Style:**
*   Use clear phases demarcated on the timeline.
*   Within each track, use milestone markers or summary descriptions for each phase.
*   Arrows can show dependencies between tracks if necessary (e.g., module development enables higher AGI stages).
*   Visually appealing, easy to read, and conveys a sense of progression and ambition.

**Purpose:** To provide a strategic overview of the PiaAGI research roadmap, illustrating the planned progression of AGI capabilities through developmental stages, advancements in core cognitive functions, evolution of scaffolding techniques, and continuous focus on ethical development and safety.
