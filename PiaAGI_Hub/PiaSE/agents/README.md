# PiaSE Agents

This directory contains agent interfaces and example agent implementations for PiaSE.

-   `basic_grid_agent.py`: A concrete implementation of the `AgentInterface`. It can be configured with a "random" action policy or a simple "goal_oriented" policy for navigation in `GridWorld`.

Refer to the main [PiaSE README](../../README.md) for more context.
