# PiaSE Scenarios

This directory includes scripts and configurations for defining and running specific experimental scenarios in PiaSE.

-   `grid_world_scenario.py`: A runnable Python script that demonstrates the setup and interaction of the `BasicSimulationEngine`, `GridWorld`, and `BasicGridAgent` components.
    -   The scenario now demonstrates the `QLearningAgent` learning to navigate the `GridWorld` to reach a goal, showcasing the reward and learning mechanisms.
    -   The scenario now utilizes `GridWorldVisualizer` to provide a step-by-step visual representation of the simulation.

Refer to the main [PiaSE README](../../README.md) for more context.
