# PiaSE Core Engine

This directory contains the core components of the PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE).

-   `interfaces.py`: Defines the abstract base classes (ABCs) crucial for the simulation framework, including `PiaSEEvent`, `SimulationEngine`, `Environment`, and `AgentInterface`.
-   `basic_engine.py`: Provides a minimal concrete implementation of the `SimulationEngine` interface, managing a simple turn-based simulation loop.

Refer to the main [PiaSE README](../../README.md) for more context.
