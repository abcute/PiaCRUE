# PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT)

This directory contains the PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT).

PiaAVT is designed to provide researchers and developers with a comprehensive suite of tools to log, analyze, understand, and visualize the behavior, internal cognitive states, learning trajectories, and developmental progress of PiaAGI agents.

## Structure

-   `core/`: Contains the core logic for data ingestion, processing, and management.
-   `analyzers/`: Contains modules for performing various data analyses on agent logs.
-   `visualizers/`: Contains modules for creating visualizations of agent data and internal states.
-   `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the toolkit.
-   `examples/`: Contains example scripts and notebooks demonstrating how to use PiaAVT.

Refer to the main conceptual design document at [../../PiaAGI_Hub/PiaAGI_Agent_Analysis_Visualization_Toolkit.md](../../PiaAGI_Hub/PiaAGI_Agent_Analysis_Visualization_Toolkit.md) for more details on the purpose and goals of PiaAVT.
