# PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) is a toolkit designed to assist researchers and developers in the systematic design, construction, management, versioning, and evaluation of complex "Guiding Prompts" and "Developmental Scaffolding" curricula, as described in Sections 5 and 6 of `PiaAGI.md`. It aims to streamline the process of configuring and guiding PiaAGI agents, particularly in the context of AGI development.

**Goals:**
*   **Facilitate Complex Prompt Design:** Provide tools and structures to manage the complexity of multi-component prompts that configure PiaAGI's cognitive architecture (Self-Model, Personality, Motivation, Emotion, etc.).
*   **Support Developmental Scaffolding:** Enable the creation, organization, and sequencing of prompts into developmental curricula that guide agent learning and maturation through stages (Section 3.2.1, 5.4 of `PiaAGI.md`).
*   **Promote Reusability and Versioning:** Allow for the creation of reusable prompt templates, components, and configurations, with robust version control.
*   **Aid in Prompt Evaluation:** Integrate with PiaSE and PiaAVT to help researchers assess the impact of different prompt configurations on agent behavior, learning, and development.
*   **Standardize Prompting Methodology:** Encourage a more systematic and principled approach to prompting for AGI development, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt creation.
*   **Enhance Collaboration:** Allow teams to share, review, and collaboratively develop prompt libraries and developmental curricula.

## 2. Key Features and Functionalities

*   **Prompt Editor/IDE:**
    *   A specialized editor (potentially web-based or a plugin for existing IDEs like VS Code) with syntax highlighting for PiaAGI prompt structures (e.g., Markdown with special tags for R-U-E components, module configurations).

## 4. High-level Architectural Overview

*   **Core Engine (Python-based):**
    *   Manages prompt parsing, validation, storage, and versioning.
    *   Handles interaction with PiaSE and PiaAVT.
*   **Prompt Data Model:**
    *   Defines the structure of PiaAGI prompts, templates, and curricula (e.g., using Python data classes or a database schema).
*   **User Interface Layer:**
    *   Could be a combination of:
        *   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** For scripting and automation.
        *   **Web Application:** (e.g., using Flask/Django with a JavaScript frontend like React/Vue) for a rich, interactive experience.
        *   **IDE Extension:** (e.g., for VS Code) for integrated prompt editing.
*   **Version Control Integration:**
    *   GitPython library for interacting with Git repositories, or custom database-backed versioning.

    *   Python API to allow scripting of prompt generation, management, and deployment to PiaSE.

**Potential Technologies:**
*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Web Framework (if applicable):** Django, Flask, FastAPI.
*   **Frontend (if applicable):** React, Vue.js, Svelte.
*   **Database (for libraries/versioning):** PostgreSQL, SQLite, or NoSQL options like MongoDB.
*   **Syntax Highlighting/Editor components:** Libraries like CodeMirror, Monaco Editor (used in VS Code).
*   **Version Control:** Git.

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Cognitive Architecture (Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES is the primary tool for *configuring* the initial state and parameters of the cognitive modules that make up a PiaAGI agent, as described in prompts (e.g., setting Personality traits in the Self-Model, biasing the Motivational System, tuning the Emotion Module).
*   **PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE):** Prompts designed and managed in PiaPES will be deployed to PiaSE to initialize and guide PiaAGI agents within simulated environments. PiaPES will trigger experiments in PiaSE.
*   **Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML):** PiaPES will need to be aware of the configurable parameters and interfaces of modules available in PiaCML to provide accurate auto-completion, validation, and configuration options in the prompt editor.
*   **Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT):** PiaPES will integrate with PiaAVT to retrieve and display results of experiments run with specific prompts, helping users evaluate prompt effectiveness and iterate on designs. For example, comparing the learning trajectories (from PiaAVT) of an agent under two different developmental scaffolding curricula designed in PiaPES.
*   **Methodology for Prompting and Scaffolding (Section 6 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES aims to be the practical embodiment of the methodology described, providing the tools to implement architectural awareness, developmental sensitivity, holistic configuration, and iterative refinement.
*   **PiaAGI Examples (Section 7 of `PiaAGI.md`):** The complex AGI-centric examples would be created, managed, and potentially executed via PiaPES.

PiaPES will serve as a crucial enabler for the structured, systematic, and reproducible guidance of PiaAGI agents, moving beyond manual prompt crafting to a more engineered approach suitable for complex AGI development and research.


## 6. Prompt Editor/IDE Features

A specialized Prompt Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin tailored for PiaAGI would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of prompt engineering. This tool would provide features that go beyond standard text editors, offering PiaAGI-specific assistance.

### 6.1 Core Editing Features

Standard yet essential features form the baseline of the editor:

*   **Syntax Highlighting:**
    *   Custom highlighting for PiaAGI's Markdown extensions (e.g., R-U-E delineators, persona tags).
    *   Distinct highlighting for embedded configuration blocks like YAML or JSON.
    *   Highlighting for cognitive parameter keywords (e.g., `[Focus: High]`, `[Creativity: 0.7]`) to differentiate them from regular text.
*   **Code Completion (IntelliSense-like):**
    *   Context-aware suggestions for PiaAGI keywords such as `<Role>`, `<Requirements>`, `<Executor>`, `<UserContext>`, `<SystemDirectives>`.
    *   Autocompletion for PiaCML-defined module names (e.g., `PersonalityConfig`, `MotivationalBias`, `LearningRateAdapter`).
    *   Parameter suggestions within module configurations, derived from PiaCML definitions (e.g., suggesting `Openness`, `Conscientiousness` within `PersonalityConfig`).
*   **Real-time Validation:**
    *   Live schema validation against definitions in `PiaAGI.md` (specifically Sections 5: Prompt Structure, 6: Cognitive Modules, and Appendices for PiaCML).
    *   Error highlighting and tooltips for structural errors (e.g., misplaced R-U-E blocks), incorrect parameter names, invalid value types, or missing mandatory fields.
*   **Code Folding:**
    *   Ability to collapse and expand major sections of the prompt, such as the entire Requirements, UserContext, or Executor blocks.
    *   Folding for individual module configurations (e.g., collapsing a detailed `PersonalityConfig` block).
    *   Folding for custom-defined regions or verbose narrative sections.
*   **Multi-Cursor Editing:**
    *   Standard multi-cursor support to allow simultaneous editing of identical structures or parameters across different parts of a prompt or within repeated module configurations.

### 6.2 PiaAGI-Specific Features

Features designed specifically to aid PiaAGI prompt development:

*   **Visual/Structured View:**
    *   A dedicated panel or mode that renders the prompt's logical hierarchy. This could be a tree view (e.g., `Prompt -> Requirements -> TaskDefinition`, `Prompt -> Executors -> Executor-1 -> Role -> CognitiveModuleConfiguration -> PersonalityConfig`).
    *   This view would allow for quick navigation, especially in complex prompts with multiple executors or deeply nested configurations.
    *   Clicking on a node in the tree could jump to the corresponding section in the text editor.
*   **Cognitive Parameter Sliders/Pickers (Conceptual):**
    *   For certain numerical (e.g., OCEAN scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, motivation weights) or categorical cognitive parameters (e.g., predefined emotional states), a graphical user interface (GUI) element could be provided.
    *   Users could manipulate sliders or select from dropdowns, and the editor would translate these actions into the correct prompt syntax (e.g., `[OCEAN.Openness: 0.8]`). This simplifies tuning and reduces syntax errors.
*   **Direct Linking to Documentation:**
    *   Right-click or hover-over functionality on PiaAGI keywords (e.g., `<Constraint>`), module names (`EthicalGovernor`), or parameters.
    *   This would trigger a pop-up with a brief description and/or a direct link to the relevant definition or section in `PiaAGI.md` or the PiaCML specification documents.
*   **Template Insertion & Snippets:**
    *   A library of predefined templates for common PiaAGI structures.
    *   Examples: Inserting an empty `<Role>` block with placeholder sub-sections, a standard `CognitiveModuleConfiguration` with common modules, or a template for a complete R-U-E cycle.
    *   Users could also define and save their own custom snippets.
*   **Impact Preview (Conceptual):**
    *   For some well-defined cognitive parameters, particularly within modules like `PersonalityConfig` or `MotivationalBias`, the editor could offer a qualitative textual description of the expected behavioral impact.
    *   Example: Setting `[OCEAN.Extraversion: High]` might show a preview like: "Agent is likely to be more outgoing, talkative, and assertive." This is a conceptual feature requiring significant underlying logic and knowledge representation.

### 6.3 Integration & Usability

Considerations for how the editor is deployed and maintained:

*   **Platform:**
    *   **Web-based Editor:**
        *   *Pros:* Accessible from anywhere, no installation required, easier to push updates centrally.
        *   *Cons:* May have limitations in performance or offline access, potential security concerns for sensitive prompt data if not self-hosted.
    *   **IDE Plugin (e.g., for VS Code, IntelliJ):**
        *   *Pros:* Leverages existing powerful IDE features, local file access, better performance, potential for deeper integration with local development workflows.
        *   *Cons:* Requires installation and IDE-specific development, updates managed by users.
    *   *Recommendation:* An IDE plugin might be preferred for power users and complex projects, while a web version could serve for lighter use or educational purposes.
*   **Workspace Management:**
    *   Ability to open and manage individual prompt files (`.pia.md` or similar extension).
    *   Project-level management for "Curricula" (collections of related prompts for progressive learning or complex task decomposition).
    *   Easy navigation between files within a project.
*   **Modularity & Updatability:**
    *   The editor's knowledge base (PiaAGI keywords, PiaCML definitions, validation schemas) should be designed for easy updates.
    *   If `PiaAGI.md` or `PiaCML` specifications evolve, the editor should be updatable without a full rewrite, perhaps by loading updated schema files or definition libraries.
    *   This ensures the editor remains a relevant and accurate tool as the PiaAGI framework matures.

## 7. Cognitive Configuration Interface (Conceptual Design)

The Cognitive Configuration Interface is a proposed component of the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) designed to simplify the setup of an agent's core cognitive characteristics. These configurations are critical as they define the agent's baseline personality, motivations, emotional tendencies, and learning approaches, directly impacting its behavior and development.

### 7.1 Purpose and Goals

*   **Simplify Configuration:** Abstract the complexity of directly editing Python dictionaries or structured text for cognitive parameters. Provide a more user-friendly layer for configuring modules like `PersonalityConfig`, `MotivationalBias`, `EmotionalProfile`, and `LearningModuleConfig`.
*   **Enhance Intuitiveness:** Enable users, including those not deeply versed in PiaAGI's internal class structures (e.g., `prompt_engine_mvp.py`), to make informed decisions about cognitive settings.
*   **Ensure Validity:** Guide users towards creating valid configurations that adhere to PiaCML definitions and parameter constraints (e.g., numerical ranges, accepted string values). Reduce syntax and semantic errors.
*   **Standardize Output:** Generate cognitive configurations in a consistent format (e.g., Python dictionary string, YAML, or JSON) that is easily insertable into PiaAGI prompt templates or directly usable by the prompt engine classes.

### 7.2 Interface Modalities

Two primary modalities are envisioned, potentially coexisting to serve different user preferences and use cases:

#### 7.2.1 Structured Text Input (e.g., YAML/JSON)

This modality allows users to define cognitive configurations using text formats like YAML or JSON.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Familiar to developers and those comfortable with structured data.
    *   Easy to generate programmatically or by templating.
    *   Configurations are inherently version controllable as text.
    *   Can be quickly copied, pasted, and shared.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be error-prone for manual editing, especially with complex nested structures or specific data types.
    *   Less intuitive for users unfamiliar with YAML/JSON syntax or the specific PiaCML schema.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Schema Validation:** Real-time validation against PiaCML definitions for the cognitive modules. Errors regarding incorrect parameter names, types, or structures would be highlighted.
    *   **Auto-completion:** If integrated within the Prompt Editor/IDE, suggestions for module names, parameters, and valid values would be provided.
    *   **Snippets:** Pre-defined snippets for common configurations.

#### 7.2.2 Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Conceptual

A GUI would offer a more visual and interactive way to set cognitive parameters.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Highly intuitive, making it accessible to a broader range of users.
    *   Reduces syntax errors through guided input (sliders, dropdowns).
    *   Provides immediate visual feedback and context.
*   **Cons:**
    *   More complex and time-consuming to develop and maintain.
*   **Key GUI Elements (Conceptual):**

    *   **Module Selection:** A primary navigation element (e.g., tabs, a sidebar tree) allowing users to select the cognitive module they wish to configure:
        *   Personality (OCEAN Traits)
        *   Motivational Bias
        *   Emotional Profile
        *   Learning Configuration

    *   **PersonalityConfig (OCEAN Traits):**
        *   Dedicated sliders for each of the Big Five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
        *   Sliders display the typical range (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0 or 1 to 100).
        *   Adjacent text fields for precise numerical input.
        *   Brief, descriptive tooltips or text explaining the behavioral implications of high/low scores on each trait (e.g., "High Openness: Imaginative, curious, open to new experiences").

    *   **MotivationalBias:**
        *   **Intrinsic Goals:** An interface to dynamically add or remove intrinsic goals (e.g., `Curiosity`, `Competence`, `Affiliation`, `Autonomy`, `Coherence`).
            *   For each added goal, a dropdown to select qualitative priority levels (e.g., "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Very High") or a numerical input for weight (e.g., 0.1 to 1.0).
        *   **Extrinsic Goals:** Input fields to define custom extrinsic goal names (e.g., `TaskCompletion_ProjectX`, `UserSatisfactionScore`) and assign their priorities/weights similarly to intrinsic goals.

    *   **EmotionalProfile:**
        *   **Baseline Valence:** Dropdown or radio buttons to select from predefined states (e.g., "SlightlyPositive", "Neutral", "SlightlyNegative").
        *   **Reactivity:** Sliders or dropdowns to set reactivity intensity to positive events (success) and negative events (failure) (e.g., "Low", "Moderate", "High").
        *   **Empathy Level:** Options (e.g., dropdown, checkboxes) to specify target empathy levels or types (e.g., "None", "CognitiveEmpathy_Low", "AffectiveEmpathy_Moderate").

    *   **LearningModuleConfig:**
        *   **Primary Learning Mode(s):** Dropdowns or multi-select lists for choosing primary learning modes (e.g., "ReinforcementLearning", "SupervisedLearning_FromDemonstration", "UnsupervisedLearning_PatternDetection").
        *   **Learning Rate Adaptation:** Checkbox or dropdown for enabling/disabling or selecting a type of learning rate adaptation (e.g., "Fixed", "Annealing", "Adaptive").
        *   **Ethical Heuristic Update Rule:** If applicable, a text area or dropdown for selecting predefined rules or specifying custom ones for how ethical heuristics are updated or learned.

    *   **General GUI Features:**
        *   **Visual Feedback & Tooltips:** Information icons (ⓘ) next to each parameter. Hovering or clicking would reveal tooltips with detailed explanations, expected impacts, valid ranges, and potentially direct links to relevant sections in `PiaAGI.md` or PiaCML documentation.
        *   **Preset Configurations:** A system to load and save common or user-defined cognitive profiles. Examples:
            *   "Creative Explorer" (High Openness, High Intrinsic_Curiosity)
            *   "Cautious Analyst" (High Conscientiousness, Low Neuroticism, Moderate MotivationalBias for accuracy)
            *   "Empathetic Companion" (High Agreeableness, High Empathy_Affective)
        *   **Real-time Preview (Conceptual):** A small section that might offer a dynamic, qualitative summary of the agent's likely behavioral tendencies based on the current configuration.

### 7.3 Output Generation

Regardless of the input modality (text or GUI), the interface must generate a configuration snippet that is:

*   **Format:** Standardized, such as a Python dictionary string representation, YAML, or JSON.
    *   Example (Python dict string for `PersonalityConfig`):
        ```python
        {
            'ocean_openness': 0.8,
            'ocean_conscientiousness': 0.4,
            'ocean_extraversion': 0.7,
            'ocean_agreeableness': 0.6,
            'ocean_neuroticism': 0.3
        }
        ```
*   **Integrable:** Easily copied and pasted into the relevant section of a PiaAGI prompt template (specifically within an `<Executor><Role><Cognitive_Module_Configuration>` block) or consumed by the Python classes in `prompt_engine_mvp.py`.
*   **Complete:** Includes all necessary parameters for the configured modules, even if default values are used.

### 7.4 Integration with Prompt Editor/IDE

The Cognitive Configuration Interface is ideally not a standalone tool but a tightly integrated part of the broader "Prompt Editor/IDE Features" (described in Section 6).

*   **Invocation:** It could be invoked as a dedicated tab, a pop-up dialog, or a specialized view when a user focuses on or intends to create/edit a `<Cognitive_Module_Configuration>` block within a prompt file.
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   **Loading:** If an existing configuration block is selected, the interface would parse it and populate its fields (GUI or structured text view).
    *   **Saving/Applying:** Upon completion, the interface would inject the generated configuration snippet back into the prompt editor at the cursor's location or by replacing the selected block.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The interface could be context-aware, potentially drawing information from PiaCML definitions loaded by the main editor to ensure that sliders, dropdowns, and validation rules are always up-to-date with the current PiaAGI specifications.

This integration would provide a seamless experience, allowing users to switch between high-level GUI-based configuration and low-level text-based prompt editing within the same environment.

## 8. Version Control for Prompts and Curricula

As PiaAGI prompts and developmental curricula evolve through experimentation and refinement, robust version control becomes crucial for traceability, reproducibility, and collaborative development. PiaPES, through its design and recommended practices, supports versioning at multiple levels.

### 8.1 Importance of Versioning

*   **Traceability:** Track how prompts and curricula change over time, understanding the evolution of agent configurations and learning pathways.
*   **Reproducibility:** Ensure that experiments and agent behaviors can be reproduced by reverting to specific versions of prompts or curricula.
*   **Experimentation:** Allow researchers to create branches or variants of prompts/curricula for A/B testing or exploring different developmental hypotheses without losing baseline versions.
*   **Collaboration:** Enable multiple users to work on prompt and curriculum development, merging changes and resolving conflicts if necessary.
*   **Rollback:** Revert to previous stable versions in case new changes introduce unexpected or undesirable agent behaviors.

### 8.2 File-Based Versioning with PiaPES

The `save_template()` function in the PiaPES prompt engine (`prompt_engine_mvp.py`) serializes `PiaAGIPrompt`, `DevelopmentalCurriculum`, and other `BaseElement`-derived objects into JSON files (e.g., `my_prompt.json`, `my_curriculum.json`). This file-based approach inherently supports manual versioning:

*   **Manual Snapshots:** Users can save different versions of their prompts or curricula by simply saving the output JSON under different filenames (e.g., `research_prompt_v1.0.json`, `research_prompt_v1.1_experimental.json`, `early_math_curriculum_v2.json`).
*   **Directory Structure:** Organize different versions or experimental branches into separate directories.

While simple, this manual method can become cumbersome for complex projects or larger teams.

### 8.3 Leveraging Git for Robust Version Control

For more comprehensive and automated version control, **Git is highly recommended.** PiaPES-generated JSON files are text-based, making them ideally suited for Git:

*   **Repository Management:** Store all prompt templates (`.json` files for `PiaAGIPrompt`) and curriculum definition files (`.json` files for `DevelopmentalCurriculum`) in a Git repository.
*   **Change Tracking:** Git automatically tracks every change made to these files, including who made the change and when.
*   **Diffing:** Git's `diff` functionality allows for clear comparison between different versions of a prompt or curriculum, highlighting exactly what parameters or structures were modified.
*   **Branching and Merging:** Create branches for new experiments or features (e.g., a new curriculum path, a significantly altered cognitive configuration) and merge them back into the main line of development if successful.
*   **Tagging:** Use Git tags to mark specific versions as releases or milestones (e.g., `v1.0-stable-promptset`, `curriculum-phase1-complete`).

### 8.4 Internal Version Attribute

Complementing external version control systems like Git, key PiaPES objects include an optional `version` attribute:

*   **`PiaAGIPrompt(version: Optional[str])`**
*   **`DevelopmentalCurriculum(version: Optional[str])`**

This attribute allows users to embed a version string (e.g., "1.0.0", "2.1-beta") directly within the data of the prompt or curriculum.

*   **Purpose:** This internal version can be useful for quick reference, for display in user interfaces, or as metadata when loading a prompt, even if the filename itself doesn't explicitly denote the version.
*   **Synchronization:** It's good practice to keep this internal `version` attribute consistent with any Git tags or file-based versioning schemes used for the corresponding file.

By combining the structured JSON output of PiaPES with the power of Git and the optional internal version attribute, users can establish a robust and flexible system for managing the evolution of their PiaAGI prompts and developmental curricula.

## 9. Prompt Evaluation Module (Conceptual Design)

The Prompt Evaluation Module (PEM) is a conceptual component within the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES). Its primary role is to provide researchers and developers with the tools and workflows necessary to systematically assess the effectiveness of their Guiding Prompts and Developmental Curricula. By integrating with other core PiaAGI framework components, the PEM aims to offer a data-driven approach to prompt design and iteration.

### 9.1 Purpose and Goals

*   **Systematic Assessment:** Enable rigorous evaluation of how different prompts or curricula influence PiaAGI agent behavior, learning trajectories, cognitive state changes, and overall performance against defined objectives.
*   **Iterative Design Feedback Loop:** Provide actionable insights derived from evaluation results, allowing users to refine and improve their prompts and curricula based on empirical evidence.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Facilitate quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different versions of a prompt, different curriculum strategies, or different cognitive configurations (A/B testing), to determine optimal approaches for specific tasks or developmental goals.
*   **Validate Prompt Efficacy:** Help determine if a prompt is achieving its intended purpose (e.g., successfully instilling a particular skill, guiding an agent towards a specific solution path, or fostering a desired developmental outcome).

### 9.2 Key Integration Points

The PEM will function as an orchestrator, leveraging other specialized PiaAGI components:

*   **PiaSE (PiaAGI Simulation Environment):**
    *   **Experiment Execution:** PiaPES, through the PEM, will be responsible for packaging a selected PiaAGI prompt (or a sequence of prompts from a curriculum) and sending it to PiaSE to initialize and configure a PiaAGI agent instance.
    *   **Scenario Control:** The PEM will allow users to specify the simulation scenario(s), environment parameters, number of trials, and duration for each evaluation run within PiaSE.
*   **PiaAVT (PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit):**
    *   **Data Retrieval:** After simulations conclude in PiaSE, PiaAVT is assumed to collect, process, and store detailed logs (e.g., behavioral traces, task performance metrics, internal cognitive state dynamics, learning progress indicators). The PEM will query PiaAVT for this data.
    *   **Analysis & Visualization Request:** The PEM will request specific analyses and visualizations from PiaAVT. For example, if a curriculum aims to teach a skill, PiaPES might ask PiaAVT for a learning curve plot for that skill, or if a prompt configures personality, it might request an analysis of emergent behaviors correlated with those personality settings.
*   **PiaCML (PiaAGI Cognitive Module Library):**
    *   **Configuration Evaluation:** The core of many prompts involves configuring PiaCML modules. The PEM leverages PiaAVT's analysis of PiaCML module states and outputs to help users understand how their prompt configurations translate into tangible cognitive and behavioral patterns in the agent.

### 9.3 Proposed Workflow for Prompt Evaluation

A typical prompt evaluation process using PiaPES would involve the following steps:

1.  **Selection & Setup:**
    *   The user selects a specific `PiaAGIPrompt` template or a `DevelopmentalCurriculum` from their PiaPES library that they wish to evaluate.
2.  **Evaluation Configuration:**
    *   The user defines the parameters for the evaluation experiment within the PEM interface:
        *   **Target Agent:** Specify the base PiaAGI agent version or a pre-saved agent state.
        *   **Simulation Environment(s):** Choose one or more scenarios from PiaSE (e.g., "GridWorld_TaskA", "SocialInteraction_ScenarioB").
        *   **Evaluation Metrics:** Select key performance indicators (KPIs) and behavioral metrics to track. These would be metrics that PiaSE can log and PiaAVT can analyze (e.g., task success rate, time to completion, learning milestones achieved, resource utilization, ethical guideline adherence score, specific cognitive parameter changes over time).
        *   **Repetitions:** Define the number of simulation runs for each prompt/curriculum to ensure statistical significance of the results.
3.  **Execution Trigger:**
    *   PiaPES (PEM) sends the complete evaluation package (selected prompt/curriculum, agent configuration, scenario details, metrics to log) to PiaSE to initiate the simulation run(s).
4.  **Data Collection & Processing (PiaSE & PiaAVT):**
    *   PiaSE executes the simulation(s), logging the specified data.
    *   PiaAVT collects, aggregates, and processes this raw data, preparing it for analysis and visualization.
5.  **Results Retrieval & Display (PiaPES & PiaAVT):**
    *   The PEM queries PiaAVT for the processed results corresponding to the evaluation run.
    *   PiaPES then displays these results in a user-friendly format within its interface. This could include:
        *   Tables summarizing key metrics (mean, median, standard deviation).
        *   Charts and plots (e.g., learning curves, performance histograms, state trajectory visualizations) generated by or requested from PiaAVT.
        *   Direct links to more detailed dashboards or reports within PiaAVT.
6.  **Comparative Analysis (A/B Testing):**
    *   The PEM should allow users to easily set up comparative evaluations. For instance, selecting two different versions of a prompt or two distinct curricula.
    *   After both evaluations are run, the PEM would display side-by-side comparisons of their metrics and visualizations, potentially highlighting statistically significant differences identified by PiaAVT.

### 9.4 Interface Elements within PiaPES (Conceptual)

To support the above workflow, the PEM within PiaPES might include:

*   **Evaluation Experiment Setup:** A dedicated view or wizard to:
    *   Select the prompt/curriculum to be evaluated (linking to the PiaPES library).
    *   Choose the target PiaAGI agent configuration.
    *   Select PiaSE environments and scenarios.
    *   Specify metrics for PiaAVT to report on.
    *   Set the number of repetitions.
*   **"Run Evaluation" Button:** To trigger the experiment via PiaSE.
*   **Results Dashboard:** An area to display:
    *   A list of past and ongoing evaluation runs.
    *   Summarized metrics and charts for selected runs.
    *   Status indicators for ongoing simulations.
*   **Comparison View:** A specialized view for A/B testing, allowing side-by-side display of results from different evaluation runs.
*   **Configuration Presets:** Ability to save and load common evaluation experiment configurations.

### 9.5 Data Management

*   **Evaluation Run Metadata:** PiaPES (PEM) would store metadata for each evaluation run, including:
    *   A reference to the specific version of the prompt/curriculum used (e.g., filename, internal version string, Git commit hash).
    *   Date and time of the run.
    *   Configuration parameters used for the evaluation.
    *   A summary of key results.
*   **Links to Detailed Data:** While PiaPES might cache summary results, it would primarily store pointers or links to the comprehensive logs, datasets, and detailed analysis reports managed by PiaAVT, avoiding data duplication.

By providing these capabilities, the Prompt Evaluation Module would significantly enhance the empirical rigor and efficiency of developing effective Guiding Prompts and Developmental Curricula for PiaAGI agents.

## 10. Collaboration Features (Conceptual Design)

The development of sophisticated PiaAGI prompts and comprehensive developmental curricula often benefits from teamwork and shared expertise. The PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) aims to incorporate features that facilitate collaboration among researchers, developers, and designers.

### 10.1 Purpose and Goals

*   **Enable Team-Based Development:** Allow multiple users to collaboratively create, edit, manage, and refine PiaAGI prompts, prompt components, and developmental curricula.
*   **Facilitate Knowledge Sharing:** Provide mechanisms for sharing best practices, reusable prompt templates, effective cognitive configurations, and successful curriculum designs within a research group or the broader PiaAGI community.
*   **Improve Quality through Peer Review:** Integrate processes for peer review, feedback, and discussion to enhance the clarity, effectiveness, and robustness of prompts and curricula.
*   **Streamline Collaborative Workflows:** Reduce friction in multi-user projects by providing tools for versioning, change tracking, and communication.

### 10.2 Core Collaboration Mechanisms

#### 10.2.1 Shared Repositories for Prompts and Curricula

The foundation of collaboration within PiaPES revolves around shared repositories where prompt templates, curriculum definitions, and related assets (e.g., evaluation configurations) are stored.

*   **Git-based Approach (Recommended Primary):**
    *   **Leveraging Git Hosting Platforms:** PiaPES would ideally integrate with or guide users to use established Git hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Prompts and curricula, saved as `.json` or other text-based files by `prompt_engine_mvp.py`, are inherently well-suited for Git-based version control.
    *   **PiaPES Git Interface:** PiaPES could offer a simplified interface for common Git operations like cloning repositories, pulling updates, committing changes, pushing changes, and managing branches. This would lower the barrier for users less familiar with Git command-line tools.
    *   **Benefits:** Inherits robust versioning, branching, merging, conflict resolution, and access control features from Git. No need to reinvent these complex systems.

*   **Dedicated PiaPES Server/Database (Secondary/Advanced):**
    *   **Centralized Library Management:** A more complex alternative involves a dedicated PiaPES server with a database to manage shared prompt and curriculum libraries.
    *   **Pros:** Could offer very fine-grained, application-specific access control, user management, and potentially tighter integration with other PiaPES features.
    *   **Cons:** Significantly higher development and maintenance overhead for the PiaPES infrastructure. For initial stages, the Git-based approach is preferred for its simplicity and power.

#### 10.2.2 User Roles and Permissions (Conceptual)

Especially relevant for a dedicated server approach, but also applicable to Git repository settings:

*   **Owner/Administrator:** Full control over the repository/library.
*   **Editor/Maintainer:** Can commit changes, create new prompts/curricula, and merge contributions.
*   **Reviewer:** Can comment, suggest changes, and participate in review workflows.
*   **Viewer/User:** Can browse, clone/copy, and use prompts/curricula but cannot directly modify shared versions.

Git platforms provide their own well-established systems for managing collaborator permissions.

### 10.3 Commenting and Discussion Features

To facilitate feedback and iterative refinement:

*   **Inline Commenting on Prompts/Curricula (Conceptual):**
    *   Within the PiaPES editor, users could select a specific section, line, or parameter within a prompt or curriculum file and attach a comment or annotation.
    *   These comments could be stored as associated metadata (potentially in a sidecar file or, if the platform supports it, directly within the JSON structure if carefully designed).
    *   Alternatively, this could integrate with commenting features of the underlying Git platform (e.g., comments on commits or lines in a pull request).
*   **Discussion Threads per Prompt/Curriculum:**
    *   Each shared prompt or curriculum could have an associated discussion thread or forum space.
    *   This space would be used for general feedback, questions, suggestions for improvement, and tracking design decisions.
    *   If using Git platforms, this can directly map to "Issues" or "Discussions" features associated with the repository.

### 10.4 Review and Approval Workflow (Conceptual)

To maintain quality and ensure consensus for changes to shared resources:

*   **Submission for Review:** A user proposes changes to a prompt or curriculum (e.g., via a Git pull request or a "submit for review" action in a dedicated PiaPES server).
*   **Reviewer Assignment:** Designated reviewers are notified or can pick up items from a review queue.
*   **Feedback & Iteration:** Reviewers provide feedback (using commenting features). The author iterates on the changes.
*   **Approval/Merge:** Once reviewers are satisfied, the changes are approved and merged into the main version of the prompt/curriculum.
*   **Version History:** The entire process (changes, comments, approvals) is tracked by the version control system (Git).

### 10.5 Change Notifications

To keep collaborators informed:

*   Users subscribed to or "watching" a specific prompt, curriculum, or entire library could receive notifications regarding:
    *   New versions being pushed/committed.
    *   New comments or discussion entries.
    *   Review requests or status changes in a review workflow.
*   Notifications could be delivered within PiaPES, via email, or through integrations with team communication platforms, depending on the chosen backend (Git platform notifications are a good starting point).

### 10.6 Interface Elements within PiaPES (Conceptual)

*   **Collaboration Panel/Workspace:**
    *   A dedicated area in the PiaPES UI for accessing shared resources.
    *   Browser for shared repositories or libraries.
    *   Interface for Git operations (clone, pull, commit, push, branch, merge).
*   **Commenting Tools:** UI elements for adding, viewing, and replying to inline comments or discussion threads within the prompt editor.
*   **Review Management:** Views for initiating reviews, seeing pending reviews, and participating in the review process.
*   **Notification Center:** An area to display relevant updates and notifications.

### 10.7 Integration with Existing Platforms

A key principle for PiaPES collaboration features should be to **leverage existing, mature collaboration platforms** as much as possible, particularly for version control and review workflows.

*   **Git Providers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):** These platforms already offer excellent tools for repository hosting, version tracking, branching, pull requests (for review and approval), issue tracking (for discussions), and collaborator management. PiaPES should aim to integrate seamlessly with these rather than duplicate their core functionalities.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces development burden for PiaPES, allows users to work with familiar tools, and benefits from the security and scalability of established services.

By focusing on smart integrations and providing a user-friendly interface to these underlying collaborative mechanisms, PiaPES can significantly enhance teamwork in the complex endeavor of PiaAGI prompt engineering.
