# PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) is a toolkit designed to assist researchers and developers in the systematic design, construction, management, versioning, and evaluation of complex "Guiding Prompts" and "Developmental Scaffolding" curricula, as described in Sections 5 and 6 of `PiaAGI.md`. It aims to streamline the process of configuring and guiding PiaAGI agents, particularly in the context of AGI development.

**Goals:**
*   **Facilitate Complex Prompt Design:** Provide tools and structures to manage the complexity of multi-component prompts that configure PiaAGI's cognitive architecture (Self-Model, Personality, Motivation, Emotion, etc.).
*   **Support Developmental Scaffolding:** Enable the creation, organization, and sequencing of prompts into developmental curricula that guide agent learning and maturation through stages (Section 3.2.1, 5.4 of `PiaAGI.md`).
*   **Promote Reusability and Versioning:** Allow for the creation of reusable prompt templates, components, and configurations, with robust version control.
*   **Aid in Prompt Evaluation:** Integrate with PiaSE and PiaAVT to help researchers assess the impact of different prompt configurations on agent behavior, learning, and development.
*   **Standardize Prompting Methodology:** Encourage a more systematic and principled approach to prompting for AGI development, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt creation.
*   **Enhance Collaboration:** Allow teams to share, review, and collaboratively develop prompt libraries and developmental curricula.

## 2. Key Features and Functionalities

*   **Prompt Editor/IDE:**
    *   A specialized editor (potentially web-based or a plugin for existing IDEs like VS Code) with syntax highlighting for PiaAGI prompt structures (e.g., Markdown with special tags for R-U-E components, module configurations).
    *   Auto-completion for prompt keywords, module names, and parameters defined in PiaCML.
    *   Visual an/or structured view of prompt components (e.g., R-U-E, Role, Cognitive_Module_Configuration).
    *   Validation against the PiaAGI prompt schema (defined based on `PiaAGI.md` Section 5 & 6).
*   **Prompt Template Library:**
    *   Repository for storing and managing reusable prompt templates (e.g., for specific roles, developmental stages, or cognitive configurations).
    *   Ability to create new prompts by inheriting from and customizing templates.
    *   Parameterization of templates (e.g., defining variables within prompts that can be filled in for specific experiments).
*   **Cognitive Configuration Interface:**
    *   User-friendly interface (GUI or structured text) for setting parameters of cognitive modules (Personality, Motivation, Emotion, Learning) as described in Section 5.2 and example prompts (Section 7 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Visual aids to understand the range and impact of different parameter settings.
    *   Linkages to PiaCML to ensure parameter compatibility.
*   **Developmental Curriculum Designer:**
    *   Tools to sequence Guiding Prompts into curricula for developmental scaffolding (Section 5.4, 6.1 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Define prerequisite conditions or agent states for progressing to the next phase of a curriculum.
    *   Visualize developmental pathways and dependencies between scaffolding prompts.
*   **Prompt Version Control:**
    *   Integration with Git or a custom versioning system to track changes to prompts and curricula.
    *   Ability to branch, merge, and compare prompt versions.
*   **Prompt Evaluation Module:**
    *   Interface to trigger PiaSE simulations using specific prompts or curricula.
    *   Integration with PiaAVT to retrieve and display key performance metrics and visualizations related to prompt effectiveness.
    *   Tools for A/B testing different prompt variations.
*   **Collaboration Features:**
    *   Shared repositories for prompt libraries and curricula.
    *   Commenting and review features for prompts.
*   **Import/Export Functionality:**
    *   Import/export prompts and curricula in standard formats (e.g., Markdown, JSON, XML).

## 3. Target Users

*   **PiaAGI Developers & Researchers:** Primary users for configuring agents, designing experiments, and managing developmental processes.
*   **AI Prompt Engineers:** Specialists focusing on crafting effective interactions and configurations for advanced AI systems.
*   **Cognitive Scientists/Psychologists:** For designing prompts that instantiate specific psychological theories or experimental conditions for PiaAGI agents.
*   **Educators/Curriculum Designers:** For creating learning pathways for AGI agents (and potentially for human learners interacting with PiaAGI tutors).

## 4. High-level Architectural Overview

*   **Core Engine (Python-based):**
    *   Manages prompt parsing, validation, storage, and versioning.
    *   Handles interaction with PiaSE and PiaAVT.
*   **Prompt Data Model:**
    *   Defines the structure of PiaAGI prompts, templates, and curricula (e.g., using Python data classes or a database schema).
*   **User Interface Layer:**
    *   Could be a combination of:
        *   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** For scripting and automation.
        *   **Web Application:** (e.g., using Flask/Django with a JavaScript frontend like React/Vue) for a rich, interactive experience.
        *   **IDE Extension:** (e.g., for VS Code) for integrated prompt editing.
*   **Version Control Integration:**
    *   GitPython library for interacting with Git repositories, or custom database-backed versioning.
*   **API for Programmatic Access:**
    *   Python API to allow scripting of prompt generation, management, and deployment to PiaSE.

**Potential Technologies:**
*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Web Framework (if applicable):** Django, Flask, FastAPI.
*   **Frontend (if applicable):** React, Vue.js, Svelte.
*   **Database (for libraries/versioning):** PostgreSQL, SQLite, or NoSQL options like MongoDB.
*   **Syntax Highlighting/Editor components:** Libraries like CodeMirror, Monaco Editor (used in VS Code).
*   **Version Control:** Git.

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Cognitive Architecture (Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES is the primary tool for *configuring* the initial state and parameters of the cognitive modules that make up a PiaAGI agent, as described in prompts (e.g., setting Personality traits in the Self-Model, biasing the Motivational System, tuning the Emotion Module).
*   **PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE):** Prompts designed and managed in PiaPES will be deployed to PiaSE to initialize and guide PiaAGI agents within simulated environments. PiaPES will trigger experiments in PiaSE.
*   **Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML):** PiaPES will need to be aware of the configurable parameters and interfaces of modules available in PiaCML to provide accurate auto-completion, validation, and configuration options in the prompt editor.
*   **Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT):** PiaPES will integrate with PiaAVT to retrieve and display results of experiments run with specific prompts, helping users evaluate prompt effectiveness and iterate on designs. For example, comparing the learning trajectories (from PiaAVT) of an agent under two different developmental scaffolding curricula designed in PiaPES.
*   **Methodology for Prompting and Scaffolding (Section 6 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES aims to be the practical embodiment of the methodology described, providing the tools to implement architectural awareness, developmental sensitivity, holistic configuration, and iterative refinement.
*   **PiaAGI Examples (Section 7 of `PiaAGI.md`):** The complex AGI-centric examples would be created, managed, and potentially executed via PiaPES.

PiaPES will serve as a crucial enabler for the structured, systematic, and reproducible guidance of PiaAGI agents, moving beyond manual prompt crafting to a more engineered approach suitable for complex AGI development and research.
