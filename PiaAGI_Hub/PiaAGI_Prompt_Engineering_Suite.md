# PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) is a toolkit designed to assist researchers and developers in the systematic design, construction, management, versioning, and evaluation of complex "Guiding Prompts" and "Developmental Scaffolding" curricula, as described in Sections 5 and 6 of `PiaAGI.md`. It aims to streamline the process of configuring and guiding PiaAGI agents, particularly in the context of AGI development.

**Goals:**
*   **Facilitate Complex Prompt Design:** Provide tools and structures to manage the complexity of multi-component prompts that configure PiaAGI's cognitive architecture (Self-Model, Personality, Motivation, Emotion, etc.).
*   **Support Developmental Scaffolding:** Enable the creation, organization, and sequencing of prompts into developmental curricula that guide agent learning and maturation through stages (Section 3.2.1, 5.4 of `PiaAGI.md`).
*   **Promote Reusability and Versioning:** Allow for the creation of reusable prompt templates, components, and configurations, with robust version control.
*   **Aid in Prompt Evaluation:** Integrate with PiaSE and PiaAVT to help researchers assess the impact of different prompt configurations on agent behavior, learning, and development.
*   **Standardize Prompting Methodology:** Encourage a more systematic and principled approach to prompting for AGI development, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt creation.
*   **Enhance Collaboration:** Allow teams to share, review, and collaboratively develop prompt libraries and developmental curricula.

## 2. Key Features and Functionalities

*   **Prompt Editor/IDE:**
    *   A specialized editor (potentially web-based or a plugin for existing IDEs like VS Code) with syntax highlighting for PiaAGI prompt structures (e.g., Markdown with special tags for R-U-E components, module configurations).

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Cognitive Architecture (Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES is the primary tool for *configuring* the initial state and parameters of the cognitive modules that make up a PiaAGI agent, as described in prompts (e.g., setting Personality traits in the Self-Model, biasing the Motivational System, tuning the Emotion Module).
*   **PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE):** Prompts designed and managed in PiaPES will be deployed to PiaSE to initialize and guide PiaAGI agents within simulated environments. PiaPES will trigger experiments in PiaSE.
*   **Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML):** PiaPES will need to be aware of the configurable parameters and interfaces of modules available in PiaCML to provide accurate auto-completion, validation, and configuration options in the prompt editor.
*   **Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT):** PiaPES will integrate with PiaAVT to retrieve and display results of experiments run with specific prompts, helping users evaluate prompt effectiveness and iterate on designs. For example, comparing the learning trajectories (from PiaAVT) of an agent under two different developmental scaffolding curricula designed in PiaPES.
*   **Methodology for Prompting and Scaffolding (Section 6 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaPES aims to be the practical embodiment of the methodology described, providing the tools to implement architectural awareness, developmental sensitivity, holistic configuration, and iterative refinement.
*   **PiaAGI Examples (Section 7 of `PiaAGI.md`):** The complex AGI-centric examples would be created, managed, and potentially executed via PiaPES.

PiaPES will serve as a crucial enabler for the structured, systematic, and reproducible guidance of PiaAGI agents, moving beyond manual prompt crafting to a more engineered approach suitable for complex AGI development and research.


## 6. Prompt Editor/IDE Features

A specialized Prompt Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin tailored for PiaAGI would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of prompt engineering. This tool would provide features that go beyond standard text editors, offering PiaAGI-specific assistance.

### 6.1 Core Editing Features

Standard yet essential features form the baseline of the editor:

*   **Syntax Highlighting:**
    *   Custom highlighting for PiaAGI's Markdown extensions (e.g., R-U-E delineators, persona tags).
    *   Distinct highlighting for embedded configuration blocks like YAML or JSON.
    *   Highlighting for cognitive parameter keywords (e.g., `[Focus: High]`, `[Creativity: 0.7]`) to differentiate them from regular text.
*   **Code Completion (IntelliSense-like):**
    *   Context-aware suggestions for PiaAGI keywords such as `<Role>`, `<Requirements>`, `<Executor>`, `<UserContext>`, `<SystemDirectives>`.
    *   Autocompletion for PiaCML-defined module names (e.g., `PersonalityConfig`, `MotivationalBias`, `LearningRateAdapter`).
    *   Parameter suggestions within module configurations, derived from PiaCML definitions (e.g., suggesting `Openness`, `Conscientiousness` within `PersonalityConfig`).
*   **Real-time Validation:**
    *   Live schema validation against definitions in `PiaAGI.md` (specifically Sections 5: Prompt Structure, 6: Cognitive Modules, and Appendices for PiaCML).
    *   Error highlighting and tooltips for structural errors (e.g., misplaced R-U-E blocks), incorrect parameter names, invalid value types, or missing mandatory fields.
*   **Code Folding:**
    *   Ability to collapse and expand major sections of the prompt, such as the entire Requirements, UserContext, or Executor blocks.
    *   Folding for individual module configurations (e.g., collapsing a detailed `PersonalityConfig` block).
    *   Folding for custom-defined regions or verbose narrative sections.
*   **Multi-Cursor Editing:**
    *   Standard multi-cursor support to allow simultaneous editing of identical structures or parameters across different parts of a prompt or within repeated module configurations.

### 6.2 PiaAGI-Specific Features

Features designed specifically to aid PiaAGI prompt development:

*   **Visual/Structured View:**
    *   A dedicated panel or mode that renders the prompt's logical hierarchy. This could be a tree view (e.g., `Prompt -> Requirements -> TaskDefinition`, `Prompt -> Executors -> Executor-1 -> Role -> CognitiveModuleConfiguration -> PersonalityConfig`).
    *   This view would allow for quick navigation, especially in complex prompts with multiple executors or deeply nested configurations.
    *   Clicking on a node in the tree could jump to the corresponding section in the text editor.
*   **Cognitive Parameter Sliders/Pickers (Conceptual):**
    *   For certain numerical (e.g., OCEAN scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, motivation weights) or categorical cognitive parameters (e.g., predefined emotional states), a graphical user interface (GUI) element could be provided.
    *   Users could manipulate sliders or select from dropdowns, and the editor would translate these actions into the correct prompt syntax (e.g., `[OCEAN.Openness: 0.8]`). This simplifies tuning and reduces syntax errors.
*   **Direct Linking to Documentation:**
    *   Right-click or hover-over functionality on PiaAGI keywords (e.g., `<Constraint>`), module names (`EthicalGovernor`), or parameters.
    *   This would trigger a pop-up with a brief description and/or a direct link to the relevant definition or section in `PiaAGI.md` or the PiaCML specification documents.
*   **Template Insertion & Snippets:**
    *   A library of predefined templates for common PiaAGI structures.
    *   Examples: Inserting an empty `<Role>` block with placeholder sub-sections, a standard `CognitiveModuleConfiguration` with common modules, or a template for a complete R-U-E cycle.
    *   Users could also define and save their own custom snippets.
*   **Impact Preview (Conceptual):**
    *   For some well-defined cognitive parameters, particularly within modules like `PersonalityConfig` or `MotivationalBias`, the editor could offer a qualitative textual description of the expected behavioral impact.
    *   Example: Setting `[OCEAN.Extraversion: High]` might show a preview like: "Agent is likely to be more outgoing, talkative, and assertive." This is a conceptual feature requiring significant underlying logic and knowledge representation.

### 6.3 Integration & Usability

Considerations for how the editor is deployed and maintained:

*   **Platform:**
    *   **Web-based Editor:**
        *   *Pros:* Accessible from anywhere, no installation required, easier to push updates centrally.
        *   *Cons:* May have limitations in performance or offline access, potential security concerns for sensitive prompt data if not self-hosted.
    *   **IDE Plugin (e.g., for VS Code, IntelliJ):**
        *   *Pros:* Leverages existing powerful IDE features, local file access, better performance, potential for deeper integration with local development workflows.
        *   *Cons:* Requires installation and IDE-specific development, updates managed by users.
    *   *Recommendation:* An IDE plugin might be preferred for power users and complex projects, while a web version could serve for lighter use or educational purposes.
*   **Workspace Management:**
    *   Ability to open and manage individual prompt files (`.pia.md` or similar extension).
    *   Project-level management for "Curricula" (collections of related prompts for progressive learning or complex task decomposition).
    *   Easy navigation between files within a project.
*   **Modularity & Updatability:**
    *   The editor's knowledge base (PiaAGI keywords, PiaCML definitions, validation schemas) should be designed for easy updates.
    *   If `PiaAGI.md` or `PiaCML` specifications evolve, the editor should be updatable without a full rewrite, perhaps by loading updated schema files or definition libraries.
    *   This ensures the editor remains a relevant and accurate tool as the PiaAGI framework matures.
