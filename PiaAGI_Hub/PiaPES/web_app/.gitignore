# Ignore prompt files created by users, unless they are examples
# It's generally better to manage actual prompt data outside the repo or
# in a dedicated data store if they are not meant to be versioned with the code.
# For this MVP, users might store them here, so we provide an example of ignoring them.
# prompt_files/*.json
# !prompt_files/example_*.json
