- [x] Create textual descriptions for all diagrams requested in `PiaAGI.md` (Stored in `PiaAGI_Hub/conceptual_simulations/diagram_descriptions.md`. Future task: Integrate these into `PiaAGI.md`.)
- [x] Create `PiaAGI_Hub/conceptual_simulations/` directory.
- [x] Develop initial conceptual Python script `PiaAGI_Hub/conceptual_simulations/PiaAGI_Behavior_Example.py` illustrating simplified module interactions.
- [ ] Refine and expand `PiaAGI_Behavior_Example.py` to include more module interactions or a slightly more complex scenario (e.g., involving the Emotion Module's influence).
- [ ] Integrate textual diagram descriptions from `PiaAGI_Hub/conceptual_simulations/diagram_descriptions.md` into the main `PiaAGI.md` document (requires careful manual editing or a more robust tool).
- [ ] Develop a detailed specification document for the **Self-Model Module (Section 4.1.10)**, outlining its proposed data structures, core algorithms for metacognition, self-assessment, and the integration/application of its ethical framework.
- [ ] Outline a research plan for developing and testing the **Developmental Scaffolding methodology (Section 5.4, 6.1)** specifically for **Theory of Mind (ToM) acquisition (Section 3.2.2)** from PiaSeedling to PiaSapling stages. This plan should include potential simulation environments, interaction protocols, and evaluation metrics.
- [ ] Conduct a survey and report on existing Python libraries and frameworks that could be suitable for implementing key aspects of the PiaAGI cognitive architecture (e.g., for probabilistic reasoning, knowledge representation, symbolic AI, agent simulation, multi-agent systems).
- [ ] Begin drafting specific computational models for the **Motivational System (Section 3.3 and 4.1.6)**, focusing on how intrinsic goals (e.g., curiosity, competence) could be mathematically formulated and algorithmically implemented to drive agent behavior.
- [ ] Design a conceptual framework for the **Architectural Maturation (Section 3.2.1)** process, detailing how specific learning experiences or developmental milestones might trigger changes in module capacities or inter-module connectivity.
- [x] Create `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/` directory.
- [x] Define Abstract Base Class `BaseMemoryModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/base_memory_module.py`.
- [x] Define Interface `LongTermMemoryModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/long_term_memory_module.py`.
- [x] Define Interface `WorkingMemoryModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/working_memory_module.py`.

- [x] CML: Define Interface for `MotivationalSystemModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/motivational_system_module.py` (Ref PiaAGI.md Sections 3.3, 4.1.6).
- [x] CML: Define Interface for `EmotionModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/emotion_module.py` (Ref PiaAGI.md Sections 3.4, 4.1.7).
- [x] CML: Define Interface for `PlanningAndDecisionMakingModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/planning_and_decision_making_module.py` (Ref PiaAGI.md Sections 4.1.8, 4.4).
- [x] CML: Define Interface for `SelfModelModule` in `PiaAGI_Hub/cognitive_module_library/self_model_module.py` (Ref PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.10).

## CML Next Steps
- [ ] CML: Implement basic functionality for PerceptionModule.
- [ ] CML: Implement basic functionality for MotivationalSystemModule.
- [ ] CML: Implement basic functionality for EmotionModule.
- [ ] CML: Implement basic functionality for PlanningAndDecisionMakingModule.
- [ ] CML: Implement basic functionality for SelfModelModule.
- [ ] CML: Develop example usage of combined CML modules demonstrating basic interactions.

## Papers Directory Refinement
- [ ] Consider integrating key insights from `PiaC.md` more explicitly as historical context within relevant sections of `PiaAGI.md`.
- [ ] Review other documents in `Papers/` (beyond `PiaC.md`) for deeper alignment or integration possibilities with `PiaAGI.md` in the future, potentially summarizing them or incorporating their core ideas into the main framework document if highly relevant.
- [ ] Ensure all documents in `Papers/` consistently use relative links for images and cross-references to other project documents.
- [ ] Research and replace hypothetical paper summaries (`AI_Cultural_Evolution.md`, `AI_Narrative_Understanding.md`, `AI_Ethical_Heuristics.md`) with summaries of actual recent (2021-2024) relevant academic papers.
- [ ] Explore and detail the potential integration of Alita agent's Model Context Protocol (MCP) concepts (from `Papers/Alita_Agent.md`) into PiaAGI's tool creation (Section 3.6), Self-Model (Section 4.1.10), and Learning Module (Section 4.1.5) functionalities.
- [ ] Further elaborate on the core concept presented in `Papers/Agent_Autonomous_Tool_Mastery.md` and ensure its principles are deeply integrated and referenced throughout relevant sections of `PiaAGI.md` (especially concerning agent capabilities, autonomy, and developmental stages).
- [ ] Establish a standard template/guideline for conceptual papers in the `Papers/` directory, recommending the structure: Abstract, Summary of Core Concepts, and Implications for PiaAGI (similar to `Agent_Autonomous_Tool_Mastery.md`).
