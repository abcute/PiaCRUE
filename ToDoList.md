# PiaAGI Project Upgrade ToDo List

```markdown
# PiaAGI

PiaAGI is a project that aims to upgrade the existing PiaA project to use the latest technologies and best practices.

## Goals

- Improve performance and scalability
- Enhance user experience
- Modernize the codebase
- Ensure long-term maintainability

## Roadmap

- [P1] [ ] Phase 1: Research and Planning
    - <思考> This is a very high-level phase gate. Much of the conceptual research and planning seems to have been done, as evidenced by the extensive `PiaAGI.md` and tool design documents. However, for any *new* major development cycle, it would be high priority. Given the current state, many sub-tasks that would fall under this are already complete or are specific research tasks listed elsewhere. I'll mark this as medium as ongoing research and planning is always part of an AGI project. </思考>
    - <优先级>中</优先级>
- [P1] [ ] Phase 2: Development and Testing
    - <思考> This is another high-level phase gate. The project is clearly in a development and testing phase for its MVP tools and conceptual framework. This is where the bulk of the work lies. High priority. </思考>
    - <优先级>高</优先级>
- [P1] [ ] Phase 3: Deployment and Launch
    - <思考> This is future work, contingent on successful Phase 2. Lower priority for now. </思考>
    - <优先级>低</优先级>

    - <优先级>高</优先级>
    - [ ] **Implement WebApp Backend Logic for Core Experiment Workflow:**
        - <思考>Based on current analysis, the WebApp frontend and API definitions for experiment execution and data visualization are largely in place. However, the backend logic to (1) initialize a PiaAGI agent with PiaCML modules based on PiaPES configurations, (2) run this agent in a selected PiaSE scenario, and (3) fetch and display actual (non-mock) CML state data and PiaAVT analysis results from these runs is missing. This is the core of the "WebApp upgrade." This task is critical for the WebApp to function as an integrated platform.</思考>
        - <优先级>高</优先级>
        - [x] Backend: Implement full agent initialization logic in `/api/experiments/run` (P1-2 from WebApp_ToDoList).
        - [x] Backend: Implement PiaSE simulation execution logic in `/api/experiments/run` (P1-3 from WebApp_ToDoList).

        - [x] Backend: Replace mock data/client with actual PiaAVT integration for analysis APIs (`/api/avt/analysis/.../<run_id>`).
        - [x] Backend: Implement actual listing of PiaSE scenarios for `/api/se/scenarios`.
        - [x] Backend: Implement support for agent templates if `AgentTemplateSelector` is to be functional.
        - [x] Backend: Ensure actual logs from PiaSE runs are accessible via `/api/experiments/logs/<run_id>`.

- [P2] [x] **Refine CML Module Interactions & Message Payloads:** Continuously review and refine the specific data passed in message payloads between CML modules and the direct API calls that remain, to optimize information flow and module decoupling for advanced scenarios. (Completed by Jules: Added clarification to ActionEventPayload; updated PiaCML_InterModule_Communication.md to reflect current bus capabilities and message structures.)
- [P2] [ ] **Tooling for AGI's Internalization of Developer Tools & Meta-Cognitive Patterns (MCPs):**
    - <思考> The sub-tasks listed under this in `ToDoList.md` (PiaAVT Logging & Analysis for Meta-Cognition) were marked as `[P2] [x]`. If this implies *further* or *broader* work on tooling for MCP internalization beyond those specific AVT tasks, it would be a significant research and development effort. Given that the specific sub-tasks are done, I'll consider this a placeholder for future, more advanced work. Medium priority for new conceptualization, if any. </思考>

(From IMPROVEMENT_TODOLIST #13)
    - <思考> This is a documentation task. While important for completeness, it's marked as a "User task" and content is provided. It doesn't block development. Medium priority. </思考>
    - <优先级>中</优先级>
- [P1] [x] Define a conceptual framework for Architectural Maturation (beyond CML hooks, possibly as a paper or core `PiaAGI.md` section). (Derived from old ToDoList - potentially superseded by CML Advanced Roadmap's hooks, but keeping if a broader framework doc is intended).
- [P3] [ ] Further explore Chain-of-Thought prompting principles and their deeper integration into PiaAGI's cognitive cycle or specific module operations. (Derived from old ToDoList)
    - <思考> This is a research task aimed at enhancing the cognitive architecture. Important for advancing the theory and capabilities, but not critical for immediate MVP functionality of existing tools. Medium priority. </思考>

- [x] Systematically review CML modules for Message Bus usage: Reviewed key modules (`WorldModel`, `SelfModel`, `Planning`, `Learning`, `Emotion`, `Perception`, `WM`, `Motivation`, `LTM`, `Attention`, `BGM`, `CommModule`, `BaseMemory`). Most integrations are sound. `ConcreteCommunicationModule` was refactored for full bus integration. (Ongoing vigilance for further decoupling opportunities remains).
- [x] Implement true asynchronous message dispatching capabilities in `MessageBus`: Reviewed current `asyncio.create_task` based asynchronous dispatch; deemed sufficient for current "fire-and-forget" needs. (Advanced features like `publish` being async are future considerations).
- [P3] [ ] Explore and implement further advanced features for `MessageBus` (e.g., enhanced routing options, more Quality of Service levels, advanced filtering).
    - <思考> This is an enhancement to a core CML component. Could improve robustness and flexibility. Medium priority. </思考>
    - <优先级>中</优先级>

## Advanced Module Features (Post-Phase 1 Prototypes) (From User's New List)

(From IMPROVEMENT_TODOLIST #11)
- [P2] [x] **[TEST] PiaCML Test Coverage for Advanced Features:** Unit tests for PiaCML modules, while good for some basic aspects (e.g., MessageBus, SelfModel confidence), do not yet cover the more complex conceptual algorithms and data structures being defined (e.g., ethical reasoning logic, WorldModel consistency checks, advanced SelfModel data components). (Completed by Jules: Enhanced test coverage for ConcreteSelfModelModule's ethical evaluation & confidence assessment, and for ConcreteWorldModelModule's prediction logic & update consistency.)
- [P2] [ ] Begin drafting/implementing more detailed computational models for the Motivational System, beyond current specifications, focusing on dynamic goal generation and interaction between intrinsic/extrinsic motivators. (Derived from old ToDoList, refined - check overlap with MSM Phase 2/3).
