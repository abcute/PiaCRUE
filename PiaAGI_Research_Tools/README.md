# PiaAGI Research Tools Suite

This directory contains conceptual design documents for a suite of Python-based research tools and utilities intended to support the development, experimentation, and analysis of agents and cognitive architectures within the PiaAGI framework.

## Conceptualized Tools

1.  **[PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE)](PiaAGI_Simulation_Environment.md)**
    *   **Description:** A flexible and extensible platform for instantiating, testing, and evaluating PiaAGI agents and their components in controlled, dynamic, and reproducible settings. It supports the creation of diverse environments, scenario management, developmental scaffolding, and multi-agent simulations.

2.  **[PiaAGI Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML)](PiaAGI_Cognitive_Module_Library.md)**
    *   **Description:** A suite of well-defined, reusable, and extensible Python libraries and software components for constructing and experimenting with the core cognitive modules outlined in the PiaAGI cognitive architecture (e.g., memory systems, learning systems, motivational engine, emotion simulator, perception, planning, self-model, ToM, communication).

3.  **[PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT)](PiaAGI_Agent_Analysis_Visualization_Toolkit.md)**
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive toolkit to log, analyze, understand, and visualize the behavior, internal cognitive states, learning trajectories, and developmental progress of PiaAGI agents. It aims to provide deep insights into agent functioning and support explainable AI.

4.  **[PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES)](PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md)**
    *   **Description:** A toolkit to assist researchers in the systematic design, construction, management, versioning, and evaluation of complex "Guiding Prompts" and "Developmental Scaffolding" curricula used to configure and guide PiaAGI agents, particularly in the context of AGI development.

These tools are envisioned to work together to provide a comprehensive ecosystem for advancing research and development within the PiaAGI framework towards Artificial General Intelligence. Each linked document provides a more detailed conceptual design for the respective tool.
