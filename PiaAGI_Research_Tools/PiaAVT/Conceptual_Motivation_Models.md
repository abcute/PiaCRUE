## 1. Introduction

This document outlines conceptual computational models for two key intrinsic motivations within the PiaAGI framework: **Curiosity and Information Seeking**, and **Competence and Mastery**. These models are intended to guide the implementation of the Motivational System Module and inform the types of data that PiaAVT should be equipped to analyze. They describe the core ideas, potential triggers, representation of intensity, influence on behavior and learning, and relevant logging considerations.

These models are foundational and can be expanded or refined as the PiaAGI project evolves.

## 2. Conceptual Intrinsic Motivation Models

### 2.1. Curiosity and Information Seeking

*   **Core Idea:**
    The agent is intrinsically driven to explore novel, surprising, or uncertain aspects of its environment or internal knowledge. The primary aim is to improve its World Model, reduce uncertainty, build a more comprehensive understanding of its operational context, and potentially uncover new opportunities or resources.

*   **Potential Triggers:**
    *   **Novel Stimuli:** Perception of stimuli that have a low match against existing representations in Long-Term Memory (LTM) or the current World Model state (logged via `PERCEPTION_INPUT_PROCESSED` with novelty metrics).
    *   **Prediction Errors:** Significant discrepancies between the World Model's predictions and actual subsequent perceptions (logged via `WORLD_MODEL_PREDICTION_ERROR`).
    *   **Knowledge Gaps/Uncertainty:** Explicit identification of concepts or relationships with low `understanding_level`, `confidence_score`, or `groundedness_score` within the Self-Model's `KnowledgeMap` (logged via `SELF_MODEL_STATE_UPDATED` with relevant flags).
    *   **Information Deficit for Goal Achievement:** Identification by the Planning Module that critical information is missing to achieve an active extrinsic or intrinsic goal (logged via `PLANNING_INFO_GAP_DETECTED`).
    *   **Observation of Unexplained Phenomena:** Complex events or behaviors observed that cannot be readily explained by the current World Model.

*   **Intensity Representation:**
    *   A scalar value (e.g., `curiosity_level` from 0.0 to 1.0) associated with a specific stimulus, concept, or area of exploration.
    *   Could be dynamically calculated based on factors like:
        *   Magnitude of novelty or surprise (e.g., degree of mismatch, prediction error size).
        *   Degree of uncertainty (e.g., variance in predicted outcomes, low confidence in knowledge).
        *   Potential information gain (estimated reduction in uncertainty or improvement in World Model accuracy).
        *   Relevance to currently active (especially blocked) goals.

*   **Influence on Behavior Generation (Planning & Action Selection):**
    *   Triggers the creation of intrinsic goals within the Motivational System (e.g., `GOAL_CREATED` with `type: "INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY"`, `description: "Investigate novel object X"`).
    *   Increases the priority of exploratory actions (e.g., `look`, `examine`, `query_database`) or information-gathering plans within the Planning Module.
    *   May lead to temporary suspension or de-prioritization of less critical extrinsic goals if curiosity intensity for a specific target is very high and deemed safe to pursue.
    *   Can influence movement patterns towards novel or unexplored areas.

*   **Influence on Learning:**
    *   Directs the Attention Module to allocate more resources to processing novel or surprising stimuli.
    *   Prompts the Learning Module to actively update the World Model based on new information gathered during exploration.
    *   Can trigger meta-learning processes within the Learning Module to refine information gathering strategies or improve the assessment of novelty/uncertainty.
    *   Information acquired can update the Self-Model's `KnowledgeMap`, increasing understanding and confidence scores.

*   **Logging for PiaAVT (Ref: `Logging_Specification.md`, `Basic_Analyses.md`):**
    *   `GOAL_CREATED`: Log with `type: "INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY"`, `description` (e.g., "Explore area Z", "Understand concept Y"), `initial_priority`, and `source_trigger_event_id` to link to the trigger.
    *   `MOTIVATIONAL_SALIENCE_CALCULATED`: Log stimulus ID, overall `salience_score`, and specific `novelty_component` or `uncertainty_component` scores.
    *   `PERCEPTION_INPUT_PROCESSED`: Include any `novelty_score` or `surprise_metric` calculated by the Perception Module.
    *   `WORLD_MODEL_UPDATE_TRIGGERED`: Log with `reason: "prediction_error_resolution"` or `"novelty_integration"`.
    *   `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED_IN_ENV`: Note actions like `explore`, `examine`, `query` when correlated with active curiosity goals.
    *   This data directly supports the "Intrinsic Motivation Trigger & Impact Analysis" detailed in `Basic_Analyses.md`.

### Algorithmic Implementation Concepts (High-Level)

*   **A. Trigger Detection & Intensity Calculation:**
    1.  **Novelty/Surprise Detection:**
        *   The Perception Module processes sensory input and compares it against LTM/World Model representations. A mismatch score (e.g., based on feature distance, reconstruction error from an autoencoder, or bayesian surprise) is calculated.
        *   The World Model, upon receiving new confirmed perceptions, compares them against its predictions. A prediction error magnitude (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence for probabilistic predictions, or difference for scalar values) is calculated.
    2.  **Uncertainty Identification:**
        *   The Self-Model's `KnowledgeMap` is periodically scanned, or queried during planning, for concepts/skills with low confidence or understanding scores.
        *   The Planning module might flag an explicit information gap if a piece of knowledge required for a plan has low confidence.
    3.  **Intensity Calculation:**
        *   A function `calculate_curiosity_intensity(trigger_type, magnitude, relevance_to_goals)` could be used.
        *   `magnitude` depends on the trigger (e.g., novelty score, prediction error size, uncertainty level).
        *   `relevance_to_goals` could be a factor if the information sought helps unblock an important active goal.
        *   The output is a scalar `curiosity_level` for the specific item of interest.

*   **B. Influence on Behavior Generation (Goal Generation & Planning):**
    1.  **Goal Generation:** If `curiosity_level` for a stimulus/concept exceeds a threshold, the Motivational System generates an intrinsic goal:
        *   `goal_type`: `INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY`
        *   `description`: e.g., "Investigate [novel_stimulus_ID]", "Understand [uncertain_concept_ID]"
        *   `priority`: Based on `curiosity_level` and potentially modulated by overall agent state (e.g., current cognitive load, urgency of other goals).
        *   `target_stimulus_or_concept_id`: Linking the goal to what needs exploration.
    2.  **Planning Integration:**
        *   The Planning module receives these curiosity-driven goals.
        *   It formulates plans involving actions like `explore_area`, `examine_object`, `query_database`, `request_information_from_user`.
        *   The priority of these plans is influenced by the goal's priority.

*   **C. Influence on Learning (Intrinsic Rewards):**
    1.  **Information Gain Assessment:** When a curiosity-driven goal leads to information acquisition (e.g., successful examination of a novel object, clarification of an uncertain concept), the Learning Module and World Model assess the "information gain." This could be:
        *   Reduction in uncertainty in the `KnowledgeMap` for the target concept.
        *   Improvement in World Model accuracy for related predictions.
        *   Significant update to LTM (e.g., new object representation created).
    2.  **Intrinsic Reward Generation:**
        *   If information gain is significant, an `INTRINSIC_REWARD_GENERATED` event is logged.
        *   `reward_type`: "CURIOSITY_SATISFIED" or "INFORMATION_GAINED".
        *   `magnitude`: Proportional to the assessed information gain.
        *   This reward signal can be used by reinforcement learning components within the Learning Module to strengthen the policies that led to successful information seeking.

### 2.2. Competence and Mastery

*   **Core Idea:**
    The agent is intrinsically driven to improve its skills, enhance its effectiveness in achieving goals, and master challenges presented by its environment or tasks. This involves refining existing capabilities and acquiring new ones.

*   **Potential Triggers:**
    *   **Task Failure or Sub-optimal Performance:** Failing to achieve a goal or achieving it inefficiently (e.g., high resource use, long time) can trigger a desire to improve the relevant skills or strategies (logged via `GOAL_STATUS_CHANGED` with `status: FAILED`, `TASK_STATUS_UPDATE` with `status: COMPLETED_FAILURE`).
    *   **Skill Deficiency Identification:** The Self-Model identifying a low `proficiency_level` or `confidence_in_skill` for a capability relevant to current or anticipated tasks in its `CapabilityInventory` (logged via `SELF_MODEL_STATE_UPDATED`).
    *   **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Encounters:** Successfully completing a task that was moderately challenging can motivate the agent to seek or attempt slightly more complex tasks or skill applications.
    *   **Observational Learning Cue:** If equipped with social learning capabilities, observing another agent (or human) perform a task more effectively could trigger a competence drive.
    *   **Introduction of New Tools/Abilities:** Acquiring a new tool or base-level skill can motivate the agent to practice and master its use.

*   **Intensity Representation:**
    *   A scalar value (e.g., `competence_drive_level` from 0.0 to 1.0) potentially specific to a particular skill, tool, or task domain.
    *   Influenced by:
        *   Perceived gap between current and desired/required proficiency.
        *   Importance or frequency of the skill/task for achieving overarching goals.
        *   Recent failure rates or performance metrics.
        *   Availability of resources/time for practice.

*   **Influence on Behavior Generation (Planning & Action Selection):**
    *   Triggers the creation of intrinsic goals within the Motivational System (e.g., `GOAL_CREATED` with `type: "INTRINSIC_COMPETENCE"`, `description: "Improve proficiency in skill Y"` or `"Master task Z"`).
    *   Leads to selection or generation of plans that involve deliberate practice, repetition of challenging sub-tasks, or experimentation with different strategies for a given task.
    *   May increase perseverance on tasks that offer skill improvement opportunities, even if extrinsic rewards are low or delayed.
    *   Could involve self-generated challenges or modifications to existing tasks to increase difficulty appropriately.

*   **Influence on Learning:**
    *   Engages the Learning Module(s) for targeted skill refinement. This could involve:
        *   Reinforcement learning based on performance feedback from PiaSE or internal critique from the Self-Model.
        *   Procedural learning to automatize sequences of actions for a skill.
        *   Fine-tuning parameters of existing cognitive strategies or tools.
    *   Motivates the exploration of different behavioral strategies to find more effective or efficient solutions.
    *   Successful skill improvement and mastery experiences should result in updates to the `CapabilityInventory` (e.g., increased `proficiency_level`, `confidence_in_skill`) within the Self-Model.

*   **Logging for PiaAVT (Ref: `Logging_Specification.md`, `Basic_Analyses.md`):**
    *   `GOAL_CREATED`: Log with `type: "INTRINSIC_COMPETENCE"`, `description` (e.g., "Practice navigation skill", "Refine object manipulation strategy"), `initial_priority`, `related_skill_id` (from `CapabilityInventory`), and `source_trigger_event_id`.
    *   `GOAL_STATUS_CHANGED`: Monitor progress and outcomes of these competence-driven goals.
    *   `SELF_MODEL_STATE_UPDATED`: Specifically log `SKILL_PROFICIENCY_UPDATED` events showing `skill_id`, `old_level`, `new_level`, and `reason_for_update`.
    *   `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED_IN_ENV`: Note actions that are part of a deliberate practice sequence or involve repeated attempts at a challenging task.
    *   `LEARNING_MODULE_ENGAGED`: Log with `reason: "skill_refinement"` or `"strategy_exploration"`, including any relevant parameters like learning rates or feedback signals used.
    *   `INTRINSIC_REWARD_GENERATED`: Log with `reward_type: "COMPETENCE_GAINED"` or `"MASTERY_ACHIEVED"`, `magnitude`, and `associated_goal_id`.
    *   This data supports the "Goal Dynamics & Prioritization Analysis" (for competence goals) and "Intrinsic Motivation Trigger & Impact Analysis" from `Basic_Analyses.md`.

### Algorithmic Implementation Concepts (High-Level)

*   **A. Trigger Detection & Intensity Calculation:**
    1.  **Performance Monitoring & Discrepancy Detection:**
        *   The Self-Model (`CapabilityInventory`) monitors skill execution outcomes (success/failure rates, efficiency metrics) provided by the Planning/Execution system or PiaSE.
        *   A discrepancy score is calculated between current proficiency and a target proficiency (which could be a fixed aspiration level, required level for current goals, or benchmark from ZPD).
    2.  **Failure Analysis:**
        *   Upon task/goal failure, the Learning Module or Self-Model analyzes the cause. If attributed to skill deficit, it's a trigger.
    3.  **Intensity Calculation:**
        *   A function `calculate_competence_drive_intensity(skill_id, current_proficiency, target_proficiency, goal_relevance)` is used.
        *   `goal_relevance` factor: Higher if the skill is critical for high-priority active goals.
        *   Output is a scalar `competence_drive_level` for the specific skill/domain.

*   **B. Influence on Behavior Generation (Goal Generation & Planning):**
    1.  **Goal Generation:** If `competence_drive_level` for a skill exceeds a threshold, or a significant performance failure is attributed to it, the Motivational System generates an intrinsic goal:
        *   `goal_type`: `INTRINSIC_COMPETENCE`
        *   `description`: e.g., "Improve skill [skill_ID]", "Master [task_domain_X]"
        *   `priority`: Based on `competence_drive_level` and overall strategic importance of the skill.
        *   `target_skill_or_domain_id`: Linking the goal to what needs improvement.
    2.  **Planning Integration:**
        *   The Planning module receives these competence-driven goals.
        *   It formulates plans involving:
            *   Deliberate practice: Repeating specific tasks or sub-tasks.
            *   Strategy variation: Trying different approaches to the same task.
            *   Seeking learning opportunities: Engaging with specific training scenarios in PiaSE if available.
            *   Self-experimentation: Modifying parameters of internal skills/tools.

*   **C. Influence on Learning (Intrinsic Rewards):**
    1.  **Proficiency Gain Assessment:**
        *   The Learning Module, after practice or execution attempts, updates the Self-Model's `CapabilityInventory` with new `proficiency_level` for the targeted skill.
        *   The "gain" is the difference between the new and old proficiency, or successful application of a skill in a more challenging context.
    2.  **Intrinsic Reward Generation:**
        *   If proficiency gain is positive and significant, or a challenging task is mastered, an `INTRINSIC_REWARD_GENERATED` event is logged.
        *   `reward_type`: "COMPETENCE_GAINED" or "MASTERY_ACHIEVED".
        *   `magnitude`: Proportional to the assessed proficiency gain or the challenge level overcome.
        *   This reward reinforces the learning strategies and practice behaviors that led to improvement.
        *   It can also update the `confidence_in_skill` within the Self-Model.

These conceptual models provide a basis for implementing and analyzing intrinsic motivations in PiaAGI. They will be subject to refinement through empirical testing and further theoretical development.
