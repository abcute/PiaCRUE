# Self-Model Dashboard for PiaAVT (Conceptual Design)

## 1. Introduction/Purpose of the Self-Model Dashboard

The Self-Model in a PiaAGI agent is a crucial cognitive component responsible for self-representation, including its capabilities, limitations, values, ethical framework, personality, and developmental status. Understanding the state and dynamics of the Self-Model is vital for researchers to assess agent self-awareness, learning progress, ethical alignment, and overall cognitive coherence.

The Self-Model Dashboard in PiaAVT aims to provide a centralized, interactive, and visually intuitive interface for inspecting these key aspects of an agent's Self-Model. Its primary purposes are:

*   **Monitoring Self-Awareness:** To provide insights into how the agent perceives its own abilities, knowledge, and limitations.
*   **Tracking Development:** To visualize the agent's progress through developmental stages and the evolution of its self-perception.
*   **Assessing Ethical Alignment:** To display the core components of the agent's ethical framework and how they might be changing or influencing behavior.
*   **Understanding Personality & Behavior:** To show how configured personality traits are represented and potentially correlate with observable behaviors.
*   **Debugging Self-Representation:** To identify potential inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the agent's Self-Model that might lead to suboptimal or problematic behavior.
*   **Supporting XAI:** To contribute to explaining agent behavior by showing the self-perceptions and values that might be driving it.

## 2. Key Self-Model Aspects to Visualize

The dashboard should present information derived from logs generated by the PiaCML Self-Model module. Key aspects include:

*   **Self-Assessed Capabilities & Competencies:**
    *   Knowledge domains and specific skills the agent believes it possesses.
    *   Confidence levels or proficiency scores associated with each capability.
    *   Perceived limitations or areas where knowledge/skill is lacking.
*   **Ethical Framework:**
    *   Core ethical principles, values, and moral heuristics.
    *   Current salience, hierarchy, or weights of these ethical components.
    *   History of significant ethical deliberations or applications.
*   **Personality Traits:**
    *   The agent's configured or learned personality profile (e.g., based on Big Five OCEAN model: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism).
*   **Goals & Values Alignment:**
    *   How current operational goals align with the agent's long-term core values or purpose as defined in its Self-Model.
    *   Consistency between expressed values and observed behaviors.
*   **Metacognitive State & Self-Monitoring:**
    *   Indicators of current cognitive load, uncertainty levels.
    *   Effectiveness of self-monitoring (e.g., frequency of detected self-errors).
    *   Recent self-correction attempts or learning strategy adjustments.
*   **Developmental Stage & Progress:**
    *   Current assessed developmental stage (e.g., based on Piagetian stages or a custom PiaAGI model).
    *   Progress towards defined developmental milestones.
    *   History of developmental transitions.
*   **Self-Perceived State:**
    *   Agent's representation of its own current internal state (e.g., "I am feeling curious," "I am resource-constrained").

## 3. Dashboard Layout and Component Designs

The dashboard could be organized into thematic sections or allow user customization.

*   **A. Capabilities & Competencies Overview:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Radar Chart:** For a holistic view of confidence/proficiency across 5-7 key, predefined capability areas (e.g., "Problem Solving," "Language Understanding," "Navigation," "Ethical Reasoning," "Social Interaction").
        *   **Bar Chart / Skill List:** A sortable list or bar chart showing individual skills/knowledge domains and their associated confidence/proficiency scores. Color-coding could indicate areas above/below a certain threshold.
        *   **Skill Tree (Advanced):** If skills are hierarchical, a tree view showing dependencies and mastery levels.
    *   **Interactivity:** Clicking a skill could show its learning history or related experiences.
*   **B. Ethical Framework Summary:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Value Hierarchy / Weighted List:** Display core values and principles, possibly ordered by importance or current salience. Weights or scores could be shown.
        *   **Ethical Stance Indicators:** For predefined ethical dilemmas or dimensions (e.g., utilitarian vs. deontological preference in certain contexts), show the agent's current leaning if available.
    *   **Interactivity:** Clicking a principle could link to instances where it was consulted (see Ethical Reasoning Traceability module).
*   **C. Personality Profile:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Bar Chart:** Displaying scores for key personality dimensions (e.g., OCEAN traits).
        *   **Profile Card:** A summary card with trait scores and a brief qualitative description.
    *   **Interactivity:** Hovering over a trait could show a definition or typical behavioral correlates.
*   **D. Goal-Value Alignment Monitor:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Alignment Matrix/Table:** Rows are current major goals, columns are core values. Cells indicate the degree of alignment (e.g., positive, neutral, negative, based on agent's own assessment or designer input).
        *   **Network Graph (Advanced):** Show goals and values as nodes, with edges indicating support or conflict.
    *   **Interactivity:** Clicking on a misaligned goal could bring up logs related to its formulation or potential conflicts.
*   **E. Metacognitive Dashboard:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Gauges/Sliders:** For real-time (or recent average) cognitive load, uncertainty.
        *   **Event List/Timeline Snippet:** Showing recent `AGENT_SELF_CORRECTION_ATTEMPT` or `LEARNING_STRATEGY_ADJUSTED` events.
        *   **Effectiveness Score:** A metric for self-monitoring (e.g., ratio of self-detected errors to externally detected errors, if available).
    *   **Interactivity:** Clicking a self-correction event could show the context and the correction made.
*   **F. Developmental Progress Tracker:**
    *   **Visualization:**
        *   **Timeline / Roadmap:** Displaying key developmental stages and milestones. Achieved milestones are highlighted. Expected future milestones could be shown.
        *   **Progress Bars:** For specific developmental objectives.
    *   **Interactivity:** Clicking a milestone could show criteria for its achievement and logs related to it.
*   **G. Self-Perceived State Display:**
    *   **Visualization:** A dynamic text area or status indicator displaying the agent's most recent logged self-description of its state (e.g., "Feeling: Curious (0.8), Focused (0.7); Current Need: Information_Gathering").
    *   **Interactivity:** History of self-perceived states.

    *   `PERSONALITY_CONFIGURATION_LOADED` (from system initialization or adaptation).

## 5. Conceptual Examples of Use Cases/Insights

*   **Monitoring Learning:** A researcher observes the "Capabilities Overview." Over several simulation runs, they see the confidence score for "Navigation in Complex Environments" increase from 0.2 to 0.8, while the radar chart shows a corresponding expansion in that dimension. This indicates successful learning.
*   **Detecting Value Drift:** In the "Ethical Framework Summary," the salience of a "Safety_Preservation" value is seen to unexpectedly decrease over time after exposure to a novel training dataset. This prompts an investigation into the learning process influencing the ethical framework.
*   **Understanding Behavioral Change:** An agent suddenly becomes more cautious. The "Personality Profile" shows no change, but the "Metacognitive Dashboard" indicates a recent spike in `current_uncertainty_level` and several `AGENT_SELF_CORRECTION_ATTEMPT` events related to perceptual errors. This suggests the caution is a rational response to recent internal state, not a personality shift.
*   **Assessing Developmental Readiness:** The "Developmental Progress Tracker" shows the agent has achieved all milestones for "Stage_2_Sensorimotor_Skills" but is struggling with "Stage_3_Basic_Symbol_Use" milestones. This might guide changes to its learning curriculum.

## 6. Interactivity and Customization Options

*   **Time Range Selection:** Allow users to view the dashboard based on the Self-Model state at a specific point in time (by selecting a specific `SELF_MODEL_SNAPSHOT` or a time to reconstruct state from `SELF_MODEL_ATTRIBUTE_UPDATED` events).
*   **Historical Trends:** For numeric values (confidence, trait scores, salience), allow plotting their evolution over time.
*   **Drill-Down:** Clicking on a summary visualization (e.g., a point on the radar chart) should provide access to more detailed information or related log events.
*   **Customizable Layout:** Users might be able to select which Self-Model components are most relevant to them and arrange their visibility or order on the dashboard.
*   **Alerts/Thresholds (Advanced):** Users could define thresholds for certain Self-Model attributes (e.g., if confidence in a critical skill drops below X, flag it).

The Self-Model Dashboard aims to be a dynamic and insightful window into the agent's "mind," providing crucial information for understanding and guiding its development towards safe and beneficial AGI.
