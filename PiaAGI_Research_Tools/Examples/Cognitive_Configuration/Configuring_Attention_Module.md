# Example: Configuring the Attention Module via PiaPES Prompt

This example illustrates how a PiaPES prompt could set parameters for the `AttentionModule` of a PiaAGI agent, usually as part of a `<Role>`'s `<CognitiveModuleConfiguration>`.

*Note: The `prompt_engine_mvp.py` does not currently have a dedicated `AttentionModuleConfig` class. This example is conceptual, assuming such a class or that these parameters would be part of a general `OtherCognitiveSettings` within `CognitiveModuleConfiguration`.*

Refer to `PiaAGI.md` (Section 3.1.2, 4.1.4) for details on the Attention Module.

## PiaPES Prompt Snippet (Conceptual)

```
# Executors
## Role: Vigilant Monitoring System
### Profile: An agent designed for focused monitoring of specific data streams for anomalies.
### Cognitive Module Configuration
#### Attention Module Config (Conceptual):
    # Assuming an AttentionModuleConfig class or similar structure
    - Default Focus Mode: TopDown_GoalDirected
    # Prioritizes information relevant to current goals.
    - BottomUpSalienceThreshold: 0.85
    # How salient an unexpected stimulus must be to capture attention (0-1 scale). Higher means less distractible.
    - SustainedAttentionDurationMaxMinutes: 20
    # Conceptual limit for how long focused attention can be maintained on a single task without a "break" or shift.
    - CognitiveLoadWarningThreshold: 0.75
    # At what WM load level should the Attention module signal potential overload to Self-Model.
    # - ActiveFilterPreset: AnomalyDetection_CriticalSignals
    #   (A predefined filter set that tells the attention module what patterns to specifically look for
    #    or what to ignore, e.g., self._active_filters in ConcreteAttentionModule)
```

### Explanation:

*   **`Default Focus Mode`**: Could be `TopDown_GoalDirected` (focus guided by current tasks/goals) or `BottomUp_StimulusDriven` (more reactive to salient environmental stimuli).
*   **`BottomUpSalienceThreshold`**: A higher threshold makes the agent less easily distracted by irrelevant but salient events.
*   **`SustainedAttentionDurationMaxMinutes`**: A conceptual parameter related to vigilance and the need for attentional breaks or shifts to maintain performance.
*   **`CognitiveLoadWarningThreshold`**: The threshold at which the Attention Module (or WM's Central Executive functions it's tied to) might signal to the Self-Model that cognitive load is high, potentially triggering strategies to reduce load (e.g., narrowing focus).
*   **`ActiveFilterPreset`**: Conceptually, a way to load a predefined set of attentional filters relevant to the role, influencing what information is prioritized or suppressed (as explored in `ConcreteAttentionModule`).

This configuration aims to create an agent that can maintain focus on specific monitoring tasks while being appropriately responsive to genuinely critical unexpected events.
