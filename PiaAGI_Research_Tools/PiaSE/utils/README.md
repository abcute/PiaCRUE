# PiaSE Utils

This directory is intended for common utility functions and data structures used across the PiaSE sub-project.

- `common.py`: Placeholder for common utilities.
- `visualizer.py`: Contains the `GridWorldVisualizer` class, which uses Matplotlib to render the state of a `GridWorld` environment, including the grid, walls, agents, and goal.

Refer to the main [PiaSE README](../../README.md) for more context.
