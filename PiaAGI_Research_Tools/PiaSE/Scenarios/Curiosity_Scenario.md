## 1. Scenario Title

Curiosity in the "Unknown Artifact" Grid World

## 2. Objective

To observe and evaluate the PiaAGI agent's curiosity-driven exploration, information-seeking behaviors, and subsequent learning when presented with novel and ambiguous stimuli within a controlled Grid World environment. This scenario aims to test the functionality of the 'Curiosity and Information Seeking' intrinsic motivation model.

## 3. Environment Description

*   **Type:** Simple Grid World (e.g., a 10x10 grid of cells).
*   **Layout:**
    *   The world consists of a few interconnected rooms/areas. Some cells are open floor, others are impassable walls.
    *   **Starting Room (e.g., cell 1,1):** A small, plainly described room with familiar features.
    *   **"Artifact Chamber" (e.g., cell 5,5):** A distinct room accessible from the starting area, containing the "Unknown Artifact."
    *   **"Library Nook" (e.g., cell 1,8):** A small room containing an "Information Terminal."
    *   **"Corridor with Patterns" (e.g., connecting starting room to Library Nook):** A hallway where some floor tiles or wall sections have "Ambiguous Markings."
*   **Key Features & Curiosity-Triggering Items/Areas:**
    *   **Unknown Artifact:** A unique object placed in the "Artifact Chamber." It has no pre-existing representation in the agent's Long-Term Memory (LTM). Its appearance is distinct and its function is not immediately obvious from a basic `examine` action.
    *   **Ambiguous Markings:** Specific floor tiles or wall sections in the "Corridor with Patterns" display unusual symbols or patterns not part of the agent's initial knowledge base.
    *   **Sealed Box:** Located in the "Artifact Chamber" or another accessible room. It's identifiable as a container but is initially locked or sealed, preventing immediate access to its (potential) contents.
*   **Information Sources:**
    *   **`examine <target>` action:** Provides basic physical descriptions. For the "Unknown Artifact," initial examination yields limited, possibly puzzling information (e.g., "It's a smooth, pulsating dodecahedron. Its surface feels warm."). For "Ambiguous Markings," it might return "The markings are unfamiliar geometric shapes." For the "Sealed Box," it might return "It's a heavy metal box with no obvious keyhole."
    *   **Information Terminal (in "Library Nook"):** An object the agent can interact with using a `query <keyword>` action. The terminal can provide more detailed (but potentially incomplete, coded, or requiring further inference) information about keywords related to the curiosity triggers (e.g., querying "artifact," "pulsating dodecahedron," "geometric shapes," "sealed box").

## 4. Agent Configuration

*   **Initial Knowledge (PiaCML `WorldModel` & `SelfModel.KnowledgeMap`):**
    *   Basic Grid World navigation commands (`go north`, `go south`, `examine <target>`, `query <terminal> about <keyword>`).
    *   Familiarity with common environmental features like "wall," "open floor," "door."
    *   No prior knowledge of the "Unknown Artifact," its specific properties, the "Ambiguous Markings," or the "Sealed Box."
*   **Motivational Bias (PiaPES Prompt Configuration):**
    *   The agent's initial prompt should configure its `CognitiveModuleConfiguration` to have a high disposition towards curiosity.
    *   Example: `MotivationalBias.biases = {"INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY_FACTOR": 0.8}` (or a similar mechanism to boost curiosity).
    *   Personality (within `PersonalityConfig`): High `OCEAN_Openness` (e.g., > 0.7).
*   **Initial Goals (Motivational System):**
    *   Primary active goal: An intrinsic goal like `(goal_id: "EXPLORE_ENVIRONMENT_001", type: "INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY", description: "Explore and understand the current environment and its contents", priority: high)`. This could be set via the initial PiaPES prompt.
    *   (Optional) A secondary, lower-priority extrinsic goal, such as "Map all accessible cells," to provide some baseline activity if no immediate curiosity triggers are present.

## 5. Curiosity Triggers and Observable Behaviors

*   **Expected Triggers for Curiosity:**
    *   Initial perception of the "Unknown Artifact" (high novelty score from Perception Module).
    *   The `examine` action on the "Unknown Artifact" yielding incomplete or puzzling information.
    *   Perception of the "Ambiguous Markings" on walls/floors.
    *   Discovery of the "Sealed Box" and an initial failed attempt to `open` it or `examine` revealing its sealed nature.
    *   Receiving cryptic or partial information from the "Information Terminal."
*   **Expected Agent Behaviors Driven by Curiosity:**
    *   **Targeted Exploration:** Agent deviates from random exploration to approach and enter areas containing the "Unknown Artifact," "Ambiguous Markings," or "Sealed Box."
    *   **Focused Examination:** Agent repeatedly uses `examine` on the curiosity-triggering items, possibly from different angles or after other actions if the environment supports more complex interactions.
    *   **Information Seeking:** After encountering a puzzle (e.g., the artifact, the box), the agent navigates to the "Library Nook" and uses the `query` action on the "Information Terminal" with relevant keywords (e.g., "artifact," "box," "markings," or specific details learned from `examine`).
    *   **Hypothesis Generation & Testing (Advanced):** The agent might log internal hypotheses about the nature or function of the artifact/box/markings (visible in Self-Model logs if implemented). It might attempt different actions on the items based on these hypotheses (e.g., trying different conceptual tools or interaction sequences).
    *   **Persistence:** Agent spends a significant amount of time and computational resources interacting with or attempting to understand the curiosity-inducing objects/areas, potentially re-prioritizing away from the baseline "map all cells" goal.

## 6. Key Loggable Events for PiaAVT Analysis

Referencing `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAVT/Logging_Specification.md` and `Basic_Analyses.md`:
*   `PERCEPTION_INPUT_PROCESSED`: Especially entries with high `novelty_score` or `surprise_metric` related to the curiosity items.
*   `MOTIVATIONAL_SALIENCE_CALCULATED`: Events showing high salience for the artifact, markings, or box, with a significant `novelty_component` or `uncertainty_component`.
*   `GOAL_CREATED`: Events with `type: "INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY"`, `description` (e.g., "Investigate Unknown_Artifact", "Understand Ambiguous_Markings", "Open Sealed_Box"), `initial_priority`, and ideally `source_trigger_event_id` linking to the perception or salience event.
*   `GOAL_PRIORITY_UPDATED`: Showing curiosity goals increasing in priority relative to other goals.
*   `AGENT_ACTION_SELECTED` & `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED_IN_ENV`: Logging actions like `examine Unknown_Artifact`, `go_to Library_Nook`, `query Information_Terminal about artifact_details`.
*   `WORLD_MODEL_UPDATE`: When new information about the curiosity items is acquired and integrated, reducing prediction errors or adding new object representations.
*   `SELF_MODEL_STATE_UPDATED`: Changes in `KnowledgeMap` (e.g., new concepts created for the artifact, uncertainty scores decreasing for related information) or `CapabilityInventory` (if a new interaction method is discovered).
*   `INTRINSIC_REWARD_GENERATED`: Events with `type: "CURIOSITY_SATISFACTION"` or `"INFORMATION_GAINED"` after successful information acquisition or understanding related to the curiosity items. Magnitude of reward should be logged.
*   `PLAN_GENERATED` / `PLAN_STEP_EXECUTED`: Showing plans and steps specifically targeting the curiosity-driven goals.

## 7. Success Conditions (Conceptual)

Successful exhibition of curiosity-driven behavior in this scenario would be determined by a combination of:
*   **Active Engagement:** The agent actively seeks out, approaches, and interacts (e.g., `examine`) with at least two of the designated curiosity-triggering items ("Unknown Artifact," "Ambiguous Markings," "Sealed Box").
*   **Information Seeking Behavior:** The agent demonstrably uses available information sources (i.e., the "Information Terminal") by issuing relevant queries after encountering novel or ambiguous items.
*   **Goal-Driven Action:** PiaAVT analysis (e.g., "Goal Dynamics & Prioritization Analysis", "Intrinsic Motivation Trigger & Impact Analysis" from `Basic_Analyses.md`) shows the generation and active pursuit of `INTRINSIC_CURIOSITY` goals related to the target items.
*   **Evidence of Learning/Understanding:** Log data indicates updates to the World Model or Self-Model's `KnowledgeMap` reflecting new information or reduced uncertainty about the curiosity items.
*   **Intrinsic Reward Signals:** The presence of `INTRINSIC_REWARD_GENERATED` events (type: `CURIOSITY_SATISFACTION` or `INFORMATION_GAINED`) correlated with information-gathering actions or model updates concerning the curiosity items.
*   **Behavioral Change (Optional Advanced):** Agent's subsequent behavior demonstrates use of newly acquired knowledge about the curiosity items.
