## 5. Architectural Maturation Hooks

### Introduction

Architectural maturation, as discussed in `PiaAGI.md` Section 3.2.1 ("Stages of Cognitive Development and Architectural Maturation"), refers to the dynamic changes in an AGI's cognitive architecture over its lifespan or developmental stages. This is not just about learning new content, but about fundamental shifts in how cognitive modules operate, interact, and what resources are available to them. PiaCML modules should be designed with "hooks" or mechanisms that allow for such maturation to be simulated or guided. These hooks provide the means for the system (or an external curriculum) to adjust core functional parameters or relationships between modules.

### Conceptual Hooks for Maturation

Below are examples of how PiaCML modules could incorporate design elements to support architectural maturation.

#### 5.1 Dynamic Working Memory (WM) Configuration

*   **Module(s) Involved:** `WorkingMemoryModule`, potentially influenced by `SelfModelModule` or an external `CurriculumOrchestrator` (via PiaPES).
*   **Maturation Example:**
    *   **Capacity Adjustment:** The effective capacity of WM (e.g., number of chunks, complexity of items held) could increase or decrease.
    *   **Functional Specialization:** Parts of WM could become specialized for certain types of information (e.g., verbal, spatial, social) or tasks.
    *   **Processing Speed:** The speed at which WM can manipulate or update its contents might change.
*   **Interface/Mechanism Design Idea:**
    *   The `WorkingMemoryModule` interface could expose methods like:
        *   `set_capacity_parameters(params: Dict)`: Where `params` could specify `{ "max_items": N, "max_item_complexity": Y }`.
        *   `configure_processing_strategies(strategies: List[String])`: To enable/disable or prioritize certain internal WM processing algorithms.
        *   `allocate_specialized_buffer(buffer_name: String, buffer_spec: Dict)`: To create or resize dedicated areas within WM.
    *   Internal representations would need to allow for these parameters to dynamically alter data structure sizes or processing logic.
*   **Triggering Mechanism:**
    *   **Self-Model Driven:** The `SelfModelModule`, after observing persistent cognitive load or specific task failures/successes related to WM limits, could initiate a reconfiguration.
    *   **Curriculum-Based:** An external curriculum (e.g., managed via PiaPES) could dictate WM parameter changes as part of a developmental stage transition (e.g., "At stage X, increase WM capacity to Y").
    *   **Experience-Driven:** Prolonged engagement with tasks requiring specific types of WM resources could lead to gradual reallocation or expansion of those resources.

#### 5.2 Adaptive Learning Module Strategies

*   **Module(s) Involved:** `BaseLearningModule` (and its concrete implementations), `SelfModelModule`.
*   **Maturation Example:**
    *   **Learning Rate Adaptation:** Global or task-specific learning rates could be adjusted.
    *   **Strategy Switching:** The Learning Module might switch between different learning algorithms (e.g., from rote memorization to analogical reasoning, or from model-free to model-based reinforcement learning) based on the type of problem or developmental stage.
    *   **Knowledge Transfer Policies:** Mechanisms for transferring knowledge from one domain/task to another could be enabled or modified.
*   **Interface/Mechanism Design Idea:**
    *   The `BaseLearningModule` interface could include:
        *   `set_learning_parameters(params: Dict)`: E.g., `{ "global_learning_rate": 0.01, "strategy_preference": "deep_q_learning" }`.
        *   `enable_learning_strategy(strategy_name: String, config: Dict)`
        *   `disable_learning_strategy(strategy_name: String)`
    *   The module's internal design would need to support multiple learning algorithms/approaches that can be selectively activated or parameterized.
    *   A `learning_strategy_config` parameter within the module that can be updated dynamically.
*   **Triggering Mechanism:**
    *   **Performance-Based (SMM):** The `SelfModelModule` could monitor learning efficacy. If learning plateaus or is too slow/fast, it could trigger a change in parameters or strategy.
    *   **Instructional Scaffolding:** A curriculum or teaching signal could explicitly instruct the Learning Module to adopt a new strategy suitable for the current learning objectives.
    *   **Developmental Milestones:** Achieving certain knowledge or skill milestones could unlock more advanced learning strategies.

#### 5.3 Dynamic Inter-Module Pathway Modulation

*   **Module(s) Involved:** All modules, but particularly a central `CognitiveCoordinator` or `MessageBusRouter` if such exists, or managed by the `SelfModelModule` through influencing communication protocols.
*   **Maturation Example:**
    *   **Strengthening/Weakening Connections:** The "bandwidth" or "priority" of information flow between two modules could change. For example, the pathway between Perception and LTM might strengthen for familiar stimuli, allowing faster recognition.
    *   **New Pathway Formation:** As new skills or knowledge domains are acquired, new functional pathways might emerge (e.g., a more direct link between a specialized Perception sub-module and a specific Planning routine).
    *   **Inhibitory Control Development:** The ability to suppress or gate information flow between certain modules could develop or refine.
*   **Interface/Mechanism Design Idea:**
    *   If a central message bus is used (as per `PiaCML_InterModule_Communication.md`), its configuration could be made dynamic:
        *   `update_routing_rule(source_module, target_module, message_type, new_priority, new_filter_conditions)`
        *   `add_subscriber_dynamically(module_id, message_type, handler_function_pointer)`
    *   Modules themselves might have configurable "interest profiles" for messages:
        *   `set_message_interest(message_type, interest_level: Float, processing_priority: Int)`
    *   A conceptual `pathway_strength_matrix` or graph, perhaps managed by the `SelfModelModule` or a dedicated `ArchitectureManagerModule`, which influences how messages are routed or prioritized by the communication system.
*   **Triggering Mechanism:**
    *   **Hebbian-like Learning:** Frequent co-activation of modules in successful task completion could lead to strengthening of pathways between them.
    *   **Goal-Directed Reconfiguration (SMM/Motivational System):** To achieve a complex new goal, the `SelfModelModule` or `MotivationalSystemModule` might determine that a novel inter-module interaction is required and instruct the communication system accordingly.
    *   **Explicit Training/Shaping:** An external system could guide the formation of specific pathways by repeatedly presenting stimuli and tasks that require particular module collaborations.
