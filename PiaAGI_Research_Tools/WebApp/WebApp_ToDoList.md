# WebApp To-Do List

- [ ] **Analyze Existing WebApp Implementations:**
    - [ ] Read the code for `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/backend/app.py` and `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/frontend/src/App.jsx`.
    - [ ] Read the code for `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAVT/webapp/app.py` (Streamlit).
    - [ ] Read the code for `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/web_app/app.py` (Flask) and its `llm_config.ini.template`.
    - [ ] Read the code for `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaSE/WebApp/app.py` (Flask).
    - [ ] Understand their current functionalities, UI, and how they might be integrated.
- [ ] **Design the Unified WebApp Architecture:**
    - [ ] Decide on a primary web framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI for the backend, React/Vue for the frontend, or leverage Streamlit if suitable for all tools). The existing `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp` already uses Flask and React.
    - [ ] Plan how each toolset (PiaCML, PiaSE, PiaPES, PiaAVT) will be presented and interacted with within the unified interface.
    - [ ] Design the navigation structure.
    - [ ] Outline how LLM configuration will be managed globally.
- [ ] **Develop the Unified WebApp Backend:**
    - [ ] If Flask is chosen (as per existing `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp`), consolidate backend functionalities.
    - [ ] Create API endpoints to serve data and interact with the PiaAGI tools.
    - [ ] Integrate or adapt the LLM configuration mechanism from PiaPES.
- [ ] **Develop the Unified WebApp Frontend:**
    - [ ] Design and implement React components for each toolset's interface.
    - [ ] Focus on user experience and aesthetics.
    - [ ] Ensure responsiveness and ease of navigation.
- [ ] **Integrate PiaCML Interface:**
    - [ ] Design a way for users to conceptually interact with PiaCML. This might involve:
        - [ ] Visualizing module connections (based on `PiaAGI.md` diagrams).
        - [ ] Allowing users to see or set conceptual parameters for modules (similar to PiaPES cognitive configurations).
        - [ ] Displaying documentation or summaries for each module.
- [ ] **Integrate PiaSE Interface:**
    - [ ] Adapt or embed the existing PiaSE WebApp functionality.
    - [ ] Allow users to select and run simulations.
    - [ ] Display simulation visualizations.
- [ ] **Integrate PiaPES Interface:**
    - [ ] Adapt or embed the existing PiaPES web app functionality.
    - [ ] Allow users to design and manage prompts and curricula.
    - [ ] Ensure LLM configuration is handled correctly.
- [ ] **Integrate PiaAVT Interface:**
    - [ ] Decide how to integrate the Streamlit-based PiaAVT webapp. Options include:
        - [ ] Running it as a separate service and linking to it.
        - [ ] Embedding Streamlit components if possible (can be challenging with Flask/React).
        - [ ] Re-implementing key PiaAVT visualizations/analyses within the main WebApp framework (Flask/React).
- [ ] **Documentation and Deployment:**
    - [ ] Write a comprehensive `README.md` for the `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp` directory, including:
        - [ ] Overview of the WebApp.
        - [ ] Detailed local deployment instructions (backend and frontend).
        - [ ] Instructions for LLM configuration.
    - [ ] Update/create the main `requirements.txt` in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/backend/` and any frontend dependencies in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/WebApp/frontend/package.json`.
- [ ] **Update Root `ToDoList.md`:** Mark the WebApp task as in progress/completed.
- [ ] **Submit Changes:** Commit the new WebApp, `WebApp_ToDoList.md`, and updated documentation.
