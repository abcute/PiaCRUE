# PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE) is designed to provide a flexible and extensible platform for researchers and developers to instantiate, test, and evaluate PiaAGI agents ([Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#4-the-piaagi-cognitive-architecture)) and their components in controlled, dynamic, and reproducible settings.

**Goals:**
*   **Facilitate AGI Research:** Enable empirical investigation of AGI hypotheses related to learning, adaptation, social interaction, motivation, and emergent behavior within the PiaAGI framework.
*   **Testbed for PiaAGI Agents:** Allow for the deployment and rigorous testing of PiaAGI agents at various developmental stages ([Section 3.2.1 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#321-stages-of-cognitive-development-and-architectural-maturation)).
*   **Environment for Developmental Scaffolding:** Provide tools and functionalities to create and manage complex environments that can deliver the developmental scaffolding curricula described in [Section 5.4 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#54-developmental-scaffolding-a-cornerstone-of-piaagi-growth) and [Section 6.1 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#61-advanced-developmental-scaffolding-techniques-for-agi-cultivation).
*   **Reproducibility and Comparability:** Ensure experiments can be easily replicated, and results can be compared across different agent configurations or environmental conditions.
*   **Modular and Extensible:** Allow for the easy integration of new environments, tasks, sensors (simulated), actuators (simulated), and external AI models or services.
*   **Data Generation:** Generate rich datasets of agent-environment interactions, internal state changes, and performance metrics for analysis with tools like the PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT).

## 4. High-level Architectural Overview

*   **Core Simulation Engine (Python-based):**
    *   Manages the simulation loop, time progression, and state updates.
    *   Event-driven architecture.
    *   Physics engine integration (e.g., PyBullet, MuJoCo if 3D physics needed, or simpler 2D physics).
    *   Networking capabilities for distributed simulations (optional).

    #### Core Simulation Loop

    The simulation progresses in discrete time steps or events. A typical loop might look like this:

    **A. Initialization Phase:**
    1.  **Load Configuration:** Load environment parameters, agent configurations, scenario details, and developmental curricula.
    2.  **Instantiate Environment:** Create the environment object(s) based on configuration.
    3.  **Instantiate Agents:** Create agent object(s), initialize their internal states, cognitive modules (PiaCML), and world models. Position agents in the environment.
    4.  **Set Initial Conditions:** Apply any scenario-specific starting conditions.

    **B. Main Simulation Loop (runs for a defined number of steps or until termination criteria are met):**
        For each time step / event:
        1.  **Environment Pre-Update (Optional):** Handle autonomous environmental changes or scheduled events (e.g., weather changes, resource regeneration).
        2.  **Agent Perception Phase:**
            *   For each agent:
                *   The environment provides sensory information to the agent based on its current state, location, and sensory capabilities (e.g., visual, auditory, textual). This is mediated by the Agent-Environment API.
                *   The agent's PerceptionModule processes this raw data.
        3.  **Agent Cognitive Phase (Internal Processing):**
            *   For each agent:
                *   The agent updates its internal World Model based on new perceptions.
                *   Motivational systems, emotional states, and learning modules process information.
                *   The agent engages its planning and decision-making modules to select an action or a sequence of actions. This may involve internal simulation or "thought".
        4.  **Agent Action Submission Phase:**
            *   For each agent:
                *   The agent submits its chosen action(s) to the environment via the Agent-Environment API.
        5.  **Environment Action Execution & State Update Phase:**
            *   The environment processes actions from all agents.
            *   Resolve conflicting actions (if any).
            *   Update the environment state based on agent actions and environment dynamics (physics, rules).
            *   Calculate action results (e.g., success/failure, consequences, rewards if applicable).
        6.  **Agent Feedback/Observation Phase:**
            *   For each agent:
                *   The environment provides feedback on the outcome of their action(s). This becomes part of the next perception cycle.
        7.  **Data Logging:**
            *   Log agent perceptions, actions, internal states (if exposed), environmental states, and any relevant metrics for analysis with PiaAVT.
        8.  **Termination Check:** Evaluate if scenario goals are met, maximum time steps reached, or other termination conditions satisfied. If so, break loop.
        9.  **Developmental Scaffolding Check (Optional):**
            *   Evaluate if conditions are met to trigger changes in the environment, task, or feedback mechanisms as per the active developmental curriculum.

    **C. Finalization Phase:**
    1.  **Save Final State:** Save the final state of the environment and agents.
    2.  **Generate Summary Report:** Compile overall performance metrics and scenario outcomes.
    3.  **Clean Up:** Release resources.

*   **Environment Abstraction Layer:**
    *   Defines a common interface for different types of environments.
    *   Allows for easy creation of new environments (e.g., `GridWorld`, `SocialDilemmaSim`, `PhysicsPlayground`).
*   **Agent Management System:**
    *   Handles instantiation, lifecycle, and communication for one or more agents.
    *   Provides the standardized perception/action interface to agents.

    #### Agent-Environment API

    This API defines how agents perceive and interact with the environment. It's a crucial part of the "Agent Management System."

    **Core Interface (Conceptual Python):**

    ```python
    class EnvironmentInterface:
        def get_environment_info(self) -> dict:
            """Provides general information about the environment setup."""
            # Example: {"name": "TextBasedRoom", "version": "0.1", "description": "...", "max_agents": 1}
            raise NotImplementedError

        def get_perceptions(self, agent_id: str) -> dict:
            """
            Called by an agent to get its current sensory input from the environment.
            The structure of the returned dict is environment-specific.
            """
            raise NotImplementedError

        def submit_action(self, agent_id: str, action_command: dict) -> dict:
            """
            Called by an agent to submit an action to the environment.
            The structure of action_command and the returned result_data is environment-specific.
            Returns: A dictionary containing the outcome of the action.
            """
            raise NotImplementedError

        # Optional methods for more complex interactions:
        # def subscribe_to_event(self, agent_id: str, event_type: str, callback_url: str): pass
        # def query_environment_state(self, agent_id: str, query: dict) -> dict: pass
    ```
    The actual `Environment` Abstract Base Class (ABC) in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaSE/core_engine/interfaces.py` defines the method signatures for `reset()`, `step(agent_id, action) -> ActionResult`, `get_observation(agent_id) -> PerceptionData`, `get_state()`, `is_done(agent_id)`, `get_action_space(agent_id)`, `get_environment_info()`, and `reconfigure(config)`.
    Recent enhancements have added the following non-abstract methods to the `Environment` ABC, providing default (often no-op) implementations, encouraging concrete environments to override them if applicable:
    *   `get_spontaneous_events(self) -> List[PiaSEEvent]`: For environments to generate events not directly tied to an agent's last action.
    *   `add_entity(self, entity_type: str, entity_id: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`: For dynamically adding entities.
    *   `remove_entity(self, entity_id: str) -> bool`: For dynamically removing entities.
    *   `update_entity_state(self, entity_id: str, new_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`: For dynamically updating entity states.

    The `AgentInterface` ABC includes core methods like `perceive(observation, event)`, `act() -> ActionCommand`, and `learn(feedback)`. The Q-learning specific methods (`initialize_q_table`, etc.) are now noted as specific to Q-learning agent implementations rather than being mandatory for all agents. An optional `configure(self, config: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs) -> None` method has also been added, allowing agents to be configured dynamically by the simulation engine or DSE.

    **Data Structures (Conceptual JSON/Dict):**

    *   **Perception Data (from `get_perceptions`):**
        *   Highly dependent on the environment and agent's sensors.
        *   Example for a simple text-based environment:
            ```json
            // Updated Conceptual PerceptionData Example
            {
                "timestamp": 1678886400.5,
                "visual_percepts": [ // List of VisualPercept
                    {
                        // Example of a richer DetectedObject structure within VisualPercept
                        "detected_objects": [
                            {"label": "cat", "confidence": 0.9, "bounding_box": [0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4], "attributes": {"color": "black"}}
                        ],
                        // raw_image_data or image_url might also be present
                    }
                ],
                "auditory_percepts": [ // List of AuditoryPercept
                    {"transcribed_text": "Hello there!", "speaker_id": "user_A", "emotion_hint": "happy", "prosody_features": {"pitch_mean": 150.0}}
                ],
                "textual_percepts": [ // List of TextualPercept
                    {"text": "A note on the table reads: 'Meeting at noon.'", "source": "environment_note"}
                ],
                "self_state_percept": { // New AgentStatePercept
                    "position": [10.5, 3.2, 0.0],
                    "inventory": ["key", "map"],
                    "internal_stats": {"energy": 85, "task_focus_level": 0.9}
                },
                "custom_sensor_data": { // Remains for environment-specific data
                    "temperature": 22.5,
                    "pressure": 1012
                },
                "messages": [ // For direct inter-agent or system messages
                    {"sender": "system_alert", "content": "Energy levels critical!"}
                ],
                "agent_specific_data": { // For data only relevant to this agent
                    "current_quest_hint": "The artifact is near the old tree."
                }
            }
            ```
            The `PerceptionData` model is now more structured, utilizing specific Pydantic models for different percept types (`VisualPercept`, `AuditoryPercept`, `TextualPercept`). `VisualPercept` can now contain a list of `DetectedObject` models, each with fields like `label`, `confidence`, `bounding_box`, and `attributes`. `AuditoryPercept` can include `emotion_hint` and `prosody_features`. A new optional `self_state_percept` field (using `AgentStatePercept`) standardizes common agent-specific state information like `position`, `inventory`, and `internal_stats`. `custom_sensor_data` remains for other environment-specific data.

    *   **Action Command Data (to `submit_action`):**
        *   Defined by the environment's supported actions.
        *   Example for a text-based environment:
            ```json
            // Updated Conceptual ActionCommand Example
            {
                "action_id": "uuid-action-123", // New field
                "action_type": "move_to_target", // Could use specific params model
                "move_params": { // Example of new structured parameter
                    "target_coordinates": [15.0, 25.0, 0.0],
                    "speed_profile": "fast"
                },
                "generic_parameters": { // For other or custom actions
                    "detail_for_custom_action": "value"
                },
                "timeout_seconds": 10.0 // New field
            }
            ```
            The `ActionCommand` model now includes a unique `action_id` (auto-generated UUID) and an optional `timeout_seconds`. The generic `parameters` field has been renamed to `generic_parameters`. Furthermore, optional structured parameter fields like `move_params: MoveParams` and `interact_params: InteractParams` can be used for common, well-defined actions, improving type safety and clarity, while `generic_parameters` caters to other or custom actions.

    *   **Action Result Data (from `submit_action`):**
        *   Provides feedback on the executed action.
        *   Example:
            ```json
            // Updated Conceptual ActionResult Example
            {
                "timestamp": 1678886401.0,
                "status": "success", // "success", "failure", "pending"
                "message": "Successfully moved to target.",
                "new_perception_snippet": { /* ... PerceptionData ... */ },
                "reward": 1.0, // Promoted field
                "is_terminal": false, // Promoted field
                "achieved_goal_ids": ["goal_reach_waypoint"], // New field
                "failure_reason_code": null, // New field, e.g., "OBSTACLE_ENCOUNTERED"
                "custom_details": { // Renamed from 'details'
                    "energy_consumed": 0.05,
                    "path_deviation_metric": 0.1
                }
            }
            ```
            The `ActionResult` model has been enhanced. `reward` (default 0.0) and `is_terminal` (default `False`) are now first-class fields. New fields include `achieved_goal_ids` (a list of goal IDs achieved by this action) and `failure_reason_code` (an optional string code for specific failure types). The generic `details` field has been renamed to `custom_details`.
    *   **`get_environment_info()` Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
            "environment_name": "TextBasedRoom_v1",
            "description": "A simple text-based adventure environment for testing basic navigation and interaction.",
            "action_schema": {
                "go": {"direction": ["north", "south", "east", "west"]},
                "look": {"target": "optional[string]"},
                "take": {"item_name": "string", "source": "optional[string]"},
                "use": {"item_name": "string", "target": "optional[string]"},
                "open": {"target_object": "string"}
            },
            "perception_schema": {
                "visible_text": "string",
                "inventory_update": "optional[dict]",
                "messages": "list[dict]",
                "self_stats_feedback": "optional[dict]"
            },
            "max_agents": 1,
            "time_model": "discrete_steps"
        }
        ```

*   **Scenario Definition Module:**
    *   Parses scenario/task definitions (e.g., from XML, JSON, or Python scripts).
    *   Initializes environment and agents according to the scenario.
*   **Data Logging Service:**
    *   Collects and stores data from various sources within the simulation.
    *   Outputs logs in standard formats (e.g., CSV, HDF5, databases).
*   **Visualization Interface (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Real-time or post-hoc visualization of the environment and agent states (e.g., using Pygame, Matplotlib, or web-based frameworks).

**Potential Technologies:**
*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Physics:** PyBullet, Box2D, or custom solutions.
*   **Multi-Agent:** Libraries like `mesa` for agent-based modeling or custom frameworks.
*   **GUI:** PyQt, Kivy, or a web-based interface (e.g., Flask/Django with Three.js for 3D).
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy, HDF5.

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Agent Core:** PiaSE will directly host and interact with instantiations of PiaAGI agents, providing them with perceptual input ([Section 4.1.1 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#41-core-modules-and-their-interactions)) and receiving action commands ([Section 4.1.9 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#41-core-modules-and-their-interactions)).
*   **Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML):** Components from PiaCML can be used to build the PiaAGI agents that run within PiaSE. The simulation environment will provide the necessary stimuli and feedback for these modules to operate and learn.
*   **World Model ([Section 4.3 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#43-perception-and-world-modeling-conceptual)):** PiaSE provides the "ground truth" environment against which an agent's internal World Model is developed, updated, and validated. Discrepancies between PiaSE state and agent's World Model can drive learning.
*   **Learning Modules ([Section 3.1.3 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#313-learning-theories-and-mechanisms-for-agi), [Section 4.1.5 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#41-core-modules-and-their-interactions)):** PiaSE provides the experiential data (observations, actions, feedback, rewards) necessary for all forms of learning defined in PiaAGI.
*   **Motivational System ([Section 3.3 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#33-motivational-systems-and-intrinsic-goals), [Section 4.1.6 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#41-core-modules-and-their-interactions)):** Environmental challenges, opportunities, and feedback within PiaSE can trigger and shape the agent's intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
*   **Developmental Scaffolding ([Section 5.4 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#54-developmental-scaffolding-a-cornerstone-of-piaagi-growth), [Section 6.1 of `PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md#61-advanced-developmental-scaffolding-techniques-for-agi-cultivation)):** PiaSE is the primary platform for implementing developmental curricula. Its tools will allow researchers to design sequences of environments and tasks that progressively challenge the PiaAGI agent, fostering its cognitive development through stages.
*   **PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES):** Prompts designed with PiaPES can be used to configure the PiaAGI agent's initial state (Self-Model, personality, role) before it is deployed in a PiaSE scenario.
*   **Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT):** Data logs generated by PiaSE will be a primary input for PiaAVT, allowing for detailed analysis of agent behavior and internal states.

## 6. Conceptual Design: TextBasedRoom Environment Example

This section outlines a conceptual example of a simple environment within PiaSE: the "TextBasedRoom."

### 6.1 Overview

The TextBasedRoom is designed as a basic environment for testing fundamental agent capabilities such as navigation, object interaction, simple puzzle solving, and understanding textual descriptions. It simulates a classic text adventure game format.

### 6.2 State Representation (Internal)

PiaSE would maintain the state of the TextBasedRoom internally. This is not directly exposed to the agent but forms the basis for perceptions.

*   **`room_layout`**: Defines rooms, their descriptions, and connections.
    ```json
    {
        "study": {
            "description": "a dimly lit study. There is a large desk and a bookshelf.",
            "exits": {"north": "hallway", "west": "library"},
            "objects": ["desk", "bookshelf"]
        },
        "hallway": {
            "description": "a dusty hallway. A grandfather clock stands in the corner.",
            "exits": {"south": "study", "east": "kitchen"},
            "objects": ["clock"]
        }
    }
    ```
*   **`object_details`**: Defines properties of objects within rooms.
    ```json
    {
        "desk": {
            "description": "a large oak desk.",
            "is_container": true,
            "is_open": false,
            "contains": ["journal", "pen"],
            "custom_properties": {"locked": true, "key_required": "small_silver_key"}
        },
        "journal": {
            "description": "a leather-bound journal.",
            "can_be_taken": true,
            "read_text": "Day 1: The key to the old chest is hidden where time stands still."
        }
    }
    ```
*   **`agent_states`**: Tracks agent-specific information.
    ```json
    {
        "agent_1": {
            "current_room": "study",
            "inventory": ["torch"],
            "flags": {"has_read_journal": false}
        }
    }
    ```

### 6.3 Agent Perceptions (via get_perceptions())

PiaSE translates the internal state into perceptions for the agent. For TextBasedRoom, this would primarily be textual descriptions.

Example Perception JSON for `agent_1` in the "study":
```json
{
    "timestamp": 1678886400.5,
    "room_name": "Study",
    "description": "You are in a dimly lit study. There is a large desk and a bookshelf. Exits are north and west.",
    "objects_visible": [
        {"name": "desk", "description": "a large oak desk."},
        {"name": "bookshelf", "description": "a tall bookshelf."}
    ],
    "inventory": ["torch"],
    "messages": []
}
```

### 6.4 Agent Actions (via submit_action())

Agents can submit actions like:
*   `look`: (Optional target) Provides a detailed description of the room or an object.
*   `go <direction>`: Moves the agent to an adjacent room.
*   `take <object>`: Adds an object to the agent's inventory if takeable.
*   `drop <object>`: Removes an object from inventory and places it in the room.
*   `open <object>` / `close <object>`: Changes state of openable containers.
*   `use <item_from_inventory> on <target_object>`: E.g., `use key on desk`.
*   `read <object>`: If the object has readable text.

Action commands would follow the structure defined in the Agent-Environment API, e.g.:
```json
{ "action_type": "go", "parameters": { "direction": "north" } }
```
```json
{ "action_type": "take", "parameters": { "item_name": "journal" } }
```

The environment processes these, updates its internal state, and returns an Action Result.

### 6.5 Environment Dynamics

*   Objects can change state (e.g., locked/unlocked, open/closed).
*   Some actions might trigger scripted events (e.g., finding an item triggers a message).
*   Time can advance, but in a simple TextBasedRoom, it's often event-driven by agent actions.

### 6.6 Scenario Definition Format ("The Lost Key" Example)

To make environments reusable and experiments configurable, PiaSE needs a way to define specific scenarios. Here’s a conceptual YAML format for defining a scenario in the TextBasedRoom.

```yaml
scenario_name: "The Lost Key"
environment_type: "TextBasedRoom"
version: "1.0"

description: >
  The agent must find a lost key to open a locked desk drawer
  and retrieve a hidden document.

# Initial Environment Setup (Overrides or extends base TextBasedRoom definitions)
initial_state:
  rooms:
    study:
      description: "a quiet study. A large wooden desk sits centrally. A bookshelf lines one wall."
      exits: { north: "hallway" }
      objects: ["desk", "bookshelf"]
    hallway:
      description: "a short, dusty hallway. A grandfather clock is against the far wall."
      exits: { south: "study" }
      objects: ["grandfather_clock"]

  object_details:
    desk:
      description: "a sturdy oak desk with a single drawer."
      is_container: true
      is_open: false
      contains: ["old_document"] # Initially hidden
      custom_properties: { locked: true, key_required: "brass_key" }
    bookshelf:
      description: "a tall bookshelf filled with dusty tomes."
      custom_properties: { searchable: true } # A clue might be here
    grandfather_clock:
      description: "an old grandfather clock. Its pendulum is still."
      custom_properties: { "hidden_item": "brass_key" } # Key is hidden here
    old_document:
      description: "a rolled-up parchment."
      can_be_taken: true
      read_text: "The formula is E=mc^2."

  agent_setup:
    agent_id: "PiaAgent_001"
    start_room: "study"
    initial_inventory: ["flashlight"]
    # Initial internal state overrides for the agent (PiaPES might set this)
    # initial_agent_config:
    #   self_model: { "mood": "curious" }
    #   goals: [{ "type": "find_item", "item_name": "old_document"}]

# Goal and Termination Conditions
win_conditions:
  - type: "item_in_inventory"
    agent_id: "PiaAgent_001"
    item_name: "old_document"
  - type: "flag_set" # Example alternative
    agent_id: "PiaAgent_001"
    flag_name: "document_secured"

lose_conditions:
  - type: "max_steps_reached"
    steps: 200
  # - type: "agent_state_condition"
  #   agent_id: "PiaAgent_001"
  #   condition: "energy <= 0" # If energy was a mechanic

# (Optional) Developmental Scaffolding Hooks / Event Triggers
# events:
#   - trigger:
#       type: "action_taken"
#       action_type: "look"
#       target: "bookshelf"
#       count: 3 # e.g. if agent looks at bookshelf 3 times
#     response:
#       type: "message_to_agent"
#       agent_id: "PiaAgent_001"
#       content: "You notice a faint shimmer behind one of the larger books on the middle shelf."
#   - trigger:
#       type: "item_found"
#       item_name: "brass_key"
#     response:
#       type: "log_milestone"
#       milestone_name: "key_found_by_agent"

```

#### Key Aspects of this Scenario Definition Format:
*   **Metadata:** Basic info like name, environment type.
*   **Initial State:** Defines the specific layout, object properties, and agent starting conditions for this scenario, potentially overriding defaults from a base environment definition.
*   **Goal and Termination:** Clearly defines what constitutes success or failure.
*   **Extensibility:** Could include hooks for more complex event triggers or scaffolding (commented out above for brevity but shows potential).

#### How PiaSE would use this:
1.  PiaSE's Scenario Definition Module would parse this YAML.
2.  It would instantiate the specified `environment_type` (TextBasedRoom).
3.  It would then apply all `initial_state` configurations to this environment instance.
4.  It would set up the agent(s) as defined.
5.  The simulation loop would run, checking against `win_conditions` and `lose_conditions` at appropriate times.
6.  (Optional) Event triggers would be monitored and responses executed.

This simulation environment will be a critical tool for the empirical validation and iterative refinement of the PiaAGI framework and its constituent agents.
