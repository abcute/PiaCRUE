# PiaAGI Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML) - Conceptual Design

## 1. Purpose and Goals

**Purpose:**
The PiaAGI Cognitive Module Library (PiaCML) will provide a suite of well-defined, reusable, and extensible Python libraries and software components for constructing and experimenting with the core cognitive modules outlined in the PiaAGI cognitive architecture (Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`).

**Goals:**
*   **Accelerate PiaAGI Development:** Provide researchers with off-the-shelf building blocks for PiaAGI agents, reducing redundant implementation efforts.
*   **Standardize Module Interfaces:** Define clear APIs and interaction protocols between cognitive modules, facilitating interoperability and integration.
*   **Promote Modularity and Reusability:** Encourage the development of self-contained cognitive modules that can be independently tested, refined, and reused across different PiaAGI agent configurations.
*   **Facilitate Experimentation:** Allow researchers to easily swap out different implementations of a given module (e.g., different memory models, learning algorithms) to compare their performance and impact on overall agent behavior.
*   **Bridge Theory and Practice:** Provide a concrete implementation pathway for the theoretical psychological constructs discussed in Section 3 of `PiaAGI.md` (e.g., LTM, WM, Motivation System, Emotion Module).
*   **Support AGI Research:** Enable the creation of sophisticated agent architectures for research into AGI, cognitive science, and artificial psychology.

## 2. Key Features and Functionalities

PiaCML will consist of sub-libraries/packages, each corresponding to a core cognitive module or a closely related group of functions:

*   **Memory Systems Library (`piacml.memory`):**
    *   Implementations of Long-Term Memory (LTM) variants:
        *   Episodic Memory (e.g., with temporal tagging, associative linking, emotional valence storage, Section 3.1.1, 4.1.3 of `PiaAGI.md`).
        *   Semantic Memory (e.g., knowledge graph capabilities, concept hierarchies, support for neural-symbolic representations, Section 3.1.1, 4.1.3 of `PiaAGI.md`).
        *   Procedural Memory (e.g., storing learned skills, policies, action sequences, Section 3.1.1, 4.1.3 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Working Memory (WM) implementation (e.g., based on Baddeley & Hitch model, Section 3.1.1, 4.1.2 of `PiaAGI.md`) with components like:
        *   Central Executive (for attention control, task switching, goal management, Section 3.1.2 of `PiaAGI.md`).
        *   Buffers (conceptual, for different information types).

    *   Components for:
        *   Appraisal of events/situations relative to agent goals and beliefs.

        *   Modulation of other cognitive processes (e.g., attention, learning, decision-making) by emotional states.
    *   Tools for defining and recognizing emotional expressions (conceptual, for interaction with communication modules).
*   **Perception Processing Library (`piacml.perception`):**
    *   Interfaces and basic processing tools for different sensory modalities (text, conceptual vision/audio, Section 4.1.1, 4.3 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Components for feature extraction and creating structured perceptual representations.
    *   Support for multi-modal fusion (conceptual).
*   **Planning and Decision-Making Library (`piacml.planning`):**
    *   Algorithms for classical planning, hierarchical task networks (HTN), and probabilistic planning (Section 4.1.8, 4.4 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   Integration points for utility-based decision-making and reinforcement learning policies.
    *   Mechanisms for incorporating ethical constraints (from Self-Model) and emotional biases into the planning process.
*   **Self-Model Library (`piacml.self_model`):**
    *   Structures for representing the agent's knowledge of its own capabilities, limitations, internal states, history, and personality (Section 4.1.10 of `PiaAGI.md`).

*   **Cognitive Architects:** To design and prototype novel cognitive architectures using PiaAGI modules as components.
*   **AI Researchers:** To experiment with specific cognitive functions (e.g., a new learning algorithm, a different motivational model) within a broader agent context.
*   **Cognitive Scientists & Psychologists:** To implement and test computational models of human cognition based on psychological theories.

## 4. High-level Architectural Overview

*   **Overall Structure:** A collection of Python packages, organized by cognitive function (e.g., `piacml.memory`, `piacml.learning`).
*   **Modularity:** Each module designed with a clear API (abstract base classes, defined interfaces) for inputs, outputs, and parameter configuration.
*   **Extensibility:** Users can create new implementations of module interfaces or extend existing ones.
*   **Interoperability:** While modules can be used independently, their APIs will be designed to facilitate easy connection and data flow within a full PiaAGI agent architecture.
*   **Core Data Structures:** Define common data structures for representing knowledge, goals, emotional states, etc., to be used across modules.
*   **Utilities:** Common utility functions (e.g., for logging, configuration management, serialization) shared across the library.

**Potential Technologies:**
*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Neural Network Components:** Leveraging libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow for sub-symbolic aspects within modules (e.g., representation learning in Semantic LTM, policy networks in RL).
*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** Potential integration with symbolic AI libraries or custom logic implementations where appropriate (e.g., for certain types of planning or LTM reasoning).
*   **Knowledge Graphs:** Libraries like RDFLib or NetworkX for Semantic Memory components.
*   **Probabilistic Modeling:** Libraries like PyMC3 or Pyro for modules dealing with uncertainty (e.g., World Model, ToM).

## 5. Potential Integration Points with the PiaAGI Framework

*   **PiaAGI Agent Architecture (Section 4 of `PiaAGI.md`):** PiaCML directly provides the software implementations for the cognitive modules described in the architecture. A PiaAGI agent would be an assembly of configured modules from PiaCML.
*   **PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE):** PiaAGI agents built using PiaCML will run within PiaSE. PiaSE will provide perceptual inputs to and receive actions from agents composed of PiaCML modules.
*   **PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES):** Prompts from PiaPES will be used to configure the initial states and parameters of PiaCML modules within an agent (e.g., setting personality traits, initial goals, loading knowledge into LTM).
*   **Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT):** PiaAVT will consume data logged from PiaCML modules (e.g., memory traces, learning curves, motivational state changes, emotional trajectories) to analyze agent behavior and internal cognitive dynamics.
*   **Developmental Scaffolding (Section 5.4, 6.1 of `PiaAGI.md`):** Curricula designed via developmental scaffolding principles will be implemented by presenting tasks and environments (in PiaSE) that specifically exercise and develop capabilities of different PiaCML modules over time.

PiaCML aims to be the engine room of PiaAGI research, providing the tools to build and experiment with the minds of developing AGIs.
