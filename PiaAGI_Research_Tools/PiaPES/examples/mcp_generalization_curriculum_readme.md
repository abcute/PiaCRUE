# Developmental Curriculum: Meta-Cognition and MCP Generalization

**Author:** Jules_PiaAGI_Dev
**Version:** 1.0
**Curriculum File:** [`mcp_generalization_curriculum.json`](./mcp_generalization_curriculum.json)

## 1. Purpose

This developmental curriculum is designed to guide a PiaAGI agent, specifically at the late PiaSapling to early PiaArbor developmental stage, through the process of:
1.  Solving a series of related problems.
2.  Reflecting on its own problem-solving processes and the cognitive steps it took.
3.  Identifying recurring, successful patterns or strategies from these experiences.
4.  Generalizing these identified patterns into conceptual, reusable Meta-Cognitive Patterns (MCPs).
5.  Defining these MCPs with a name, purpose, conceptual inputs/outputs, and core logic.
6.  Conceptually storing these MCPs in its `SelfModel.CapabilityInventory` for future use.

The overall goal is to foster the agent's metacognitive abilities and lay the groundwork for self-generated cognitive tools, a key aspect of advanced AGI development as discussed in `PiaAGI.md` (Sections 3.6, 4.1.10, and 4.5).

## 2. Curriculum Structure

The curriculum consists of three main steps, each defined by a specific `PiaAGIPrompt` template:

### Step 1: Problem Solving Practice
*   **Prompt:** [`mcp_gen_prompt_step1_problem_solving.json`](./mcp_gen_prompt_step1_problem_solving.json)
*   **Objective:** The agent solves three related text transformation problems, articulating its cognitive steps for each. This generates the raw experiential data for later reflection.
*   **Key Agent Configuration:** Focus on competence, task completion, and detailed self-monitoring.

### Step 2: Reflection and Pattern Identification
*   **Prompt:** [`mcp_gen_prompt_step2_reflection.json`](./mcp_gen_prompt_step2_reflection.json)
*   **Objective:** The agent reviews its solutions and cognitive steps from Step 1 to identify common strategies or sequences of operations used across multiple solutions.
*   **Key Agent Configuration:** High curiosity, coherence, and self-understanding motivation. Learning mode focused on pattern discovery from its own processes.

### Step 3: MCP Generalization and Definition
*   **Prompt:** [`mcp_gen_prompt_step3_generalization.json`](./mcp_gen_prompt_step3_generalization.json)
*   **Objective:** The agent takes the identified patterns and abstracts them into general, reusable strategies (MCPs). It defines each MCP's purpose, conceptual inputs/outputs, and core logic, then conceptually stores it.
*   **Key Agent Configuration:** High motivation for competence, generativity, and self-improvement through tool creation. Learning mode focused on abstraction and refinement.

## 3. Target Developmental Stage

*   **PiaSapling (Late Stage) to PiaArbor (Early Stage):** Assumes the agent has foundational capabilities in problem-solving, basic LTM access for self-reflection, and the cognitive capacity for initial abstraction.

## 4. Intended Outcomes

*   Enhanced metacognitive skills in the PiaAGI agent.
*   Demonstration of the agent's ability to generalize from specific experiences.
*   Generation of conceptual MCPs that the agent can (in future development) learn to refine, implement, and utilize, contributing to its `CapabilityInventory`.
*   Provides a testbed for observing how PiaAGI's `SelfModelModule` and `LearningModule(s)` interact to support this type of higher-order learning.

## 5. Usage

This curriculum is designed to be used within the PiaPES framework. Each `CurriculumStep` references a prompt JSON file that would be loaded and used to interact with the PiaAGI agent, ideally within the PiaSE (Simulation Environment) and monitored by PiaAVT (Analysis & Visualization Toolkit).

The `YYYY-MM-DD` in the date fields of the JSON files should be replaced with the actual date of creation/use.
