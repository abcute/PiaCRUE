# PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) - MVP & Future Concepts

## Introduction

Welcome to the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES). PiaPES is a collection of tools and conceptual designs aimed at supporting the structured creation, management, and application of "Guiding Prompts" and "Developmental Curricula" for the PiaAGI (Progressive Intelligence Architecture for Artificial General Intelligence) framework.

This suite is crucial for configuring PiaAGI agents, guiding their learning and development through defined stages, and evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies.

## Current Status & Implemented Components (MVP)

The current focus is an MVP Python-based **Prompt Engine** (`prompt_engine_mvp.py`) and a basic **Web Interface**.

**`prompt_engine_mvp.py` Features:**
*   **Structured Prompt & Curriculum Creation:** Python classes (e.g., `PiaAGIPrompt`, `Role`, `CognitiveModuleConfiguration`) mirroring PiaAGI prompt structures.
*   - Structured classes for `DevelopmentalCurriculum` and `CurriculumStep` supporting curriculum design.
*   **Placeholder Substitution:** Fill `{placeholders}` in prompt attributes.
*   **Rendering to Markdown:** `render()` method for human-readable output.
*   **Saving & Loading (JSON):** `save_template()` and `load_template()` for reliable serialization of both prompts and curricula.
*   **Exporting to Markdown:** One-way export for documentation.
*   **Unit Tests:** Available in `tests/`.

**Web Interface (`web_app/`) Features:**
*   - Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for prompt template files (`*.json`) and developmental curriculum files (`*.curriculum.json`) stored in `web_app/prompt_files/`.
*   Form-based input for `PiaAGIPrompt` attributes, including detailed cognitive configurations (Personality, Motivation, Emotion, Learning) and dynamic workflow step management.
*   - Form-based input for `DevelopmentalCurriculum` metadata and dynamic management of `CurriculumStep` definitions (including linking steps to existing prompt files).
*   Rendering of prompts and curricula to Markdown.
*   Basic template loading and "save as new template" functionality.
*   - Includes `llm_config.ini.template` for potential future direct LLM integrations within PiaPES, or for reference by consuming applications (like the Unified WebApp).

For detailed usage of the MVP, refer to [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) and the [PiaPES Web Interface Design Document](./web_interface_design.md). The web app can be run from `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/web_app/` using `python app.py`.

## Future Development & Conceptual Features

PiaPES is envisioned to evolve into a comprehensive suite. Key conceptual features and future directions include:

1.  **Advanced Developmental Curriculum Designer:**
    *   - Enhance the existing `DevelopmentalCurriculum` data model (currently in `prompt_engine_mvp.py`) and associated tools in PiaPES to support:
        *   Complex dependencies between curriculum stages and steps.
        *   Branching logic based on agent performance or achieved milestones.
        *   Criteria for adaptation (e.g., if agent masters skill X, skip to step Z; if agent struggles with Y, provide remedial sub-curriculum A).
    *   Develop UI/programmatic interfaces for designing and visualizing these complex curricula.
    *   Define how PiaPES tracks an agent's state/progress across such a curriculum, potentially interacting with PiaAVT for progress metrics.

2.  **PiaPES-PiaSE-PiaAVT Integration for Evaluation & Execution:**
    *   **Prompt Evaluation Module:** Fully develop the conceptualized module for systematically assessing prompt and curriculum effectiveness.
        *   Define the workflow for PiaPES to package a curriculum, send it to PiaSE for execution with a PiaAGI agent, and then retrieve analysis results from PiaAVT.
        *   Specify the data exchange: What metrics does PiaPES need from PiaAVT to determine if a curriculum step's learning objectives were met? How does PiaSE report detailed outcomes of scenario execution?
    *   **Closed-Loop Adaptation:** Explore mechanisms where insights from PiaAVT (e.g., agent consistently fails a specific task type) could inform PiaPES to automatically suggest or trigger modifications to a developmental curriculum.

3.  **Sophisticated Cognitive Configuration Interface:**
    *   Flesh out the conceptual design for the GUI (potentially within the web app or as an IDE plugin) that allows intuitive configuration of PiaCML modules (Personality, Motivation, Emotion, Learning, etc.).
    *   This includes features like sliders for personality traits, tools for defining complex motivational goal sets, and visual aids for understanding parameter impacts, going beyond the current web app's form fields.

4.  **Prompt Editor/IDE Features:**
    *   Develop or integrate features like PiaAGI-specific syntax highlighting, auto-completion (aware of PiaCML modules and parameters), real-time validation against prompt schemas, and direct linking to relevant `PiaAGI.md` documentation within a dedicated editing environment.

5.  **Enhanced Collaboration & Version Control:**
    *   Improve support for team-based development of prompts and curricula, potentially through tighter Git integration or features for commenting and reviewing within the PiaPES UI.

**Conceptual Curriculum Example for MCP Generalization**
An example developmental curriculum, `mcp_generalization_curriculum.json` (located in the `examples/` directory along with its constituent prompts and a README), has been designed to conceptually guide a PiaAGI agent through solving problems, reflecting on its strategies, and generalizing them into Meta-Cognitive Patterns (MCPs). This demonstrates how PiaPES can be used for advanced metacognitive scaffolding.

PiaPES aims to be the central hub for designing the interactions and developmental pathways that shape PiaAGI agents, transforming prompt engineering into a more systematic and powerful methodology for AGI development.
