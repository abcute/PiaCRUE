# Project Structure and Navigation Guide

Welcome to the PiaCRUE project! This guide is designed to help you understand the structure of our repository and navigate its contents effectively.

The core idea of PiaCRUE is to treat Large Language Models (LLMs) as Personalized Intelligent Agents (Pia) and to leverage communication theory and psychological principles (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and structured requirement expression (R-U-E)) to interact with them more effectively. This project aims to share the PiaCRUE methodology, prompt strategies, specific examples, and related research to help users better understand and apply the framework.

For a comprehensive understanding of PiaCRUE's theoretical foundations and core concepts, please refer to these primary documents:
*   **[`PiaCRUE.md`](PiaCRUE.md):** Detailed explanation of the PiaCRUE framework.
*   **[`README.md`](README.md):** Overall project overview and entry point.

## Project Structure Overview

To help you quickly find the information you need, here is a description of the main files and directories in this project:

*   **`PiaCRUE.md`**: This is the central document for understanding the PiaCRUE framework. It details the theoretical underpinnings, core principles, and specific steps and methodologies for constructing effective prompts.

*   **`README.md`**: The main entry point and overview of the project. It provides a brief introduction to PiaCRUE, its primary goals, and links to other important documents and resources.

*   **`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`**: This document (which you are currently reading). It provides a map to the repository's structure and guidance on how to navigate its contents.

*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License under which the PiaCRUE project is released.

*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Provides guidelines for community members who wish to contribute to the project.

*   **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Outlines the code of conduct for all contributors and participants in the PiaCRUE community.

*   **`Papers/`**: This directory houses theoretical research papers, conceptual explorations, and in-depth analyses related to the PiaCRUE framework. These documents provide academic context and deeper insights into the methodologies.
    *   Key papers, such as `PiaC.md`, discuss the application of communication theories in LLM interactions.

*   **`Examples/`**: This directory contains various examples of PiaCRUE prompts applied in different scenarios. These examples are intended to demonstrate the practical application and flexibility of the framework.
    *   `PiaCRUE_Template.md`: A comprehensive PiaCRUE prompt template showcasing all key components.
    *   `PiaCRUE_mini.md`: A simplified PiaCRUE prompt template suitable for quick starts or less complex tasks.

*   **`Examples.md`**: This document provides an overview and illustrative snippets of PiaCRUE prompt components, helping users understand how to combine different elements to build prompts for specific needs.

*   **`Tools/`**: This directory offers methodologies, advanced prompt templates, and conceptual frameworks for generating, optimizing, and evaluating PiaCRUE prompts.
    *   **Important Note**: The "tools" in this directory refer to guiding methodologies, sophisticated prompt structures, or conceptual frameworks, **not** directly executable software packages or standalone applications.
    *   For example, `PiaCRUE_Prompt_Generator.md` is a template designed to guide users in creating customized PiaCRUE prompts.
    *   `AutoExpGPT.md` proposes a conceptual framework for the automated evaluation and optimization of prompt strategies.

*   **`pia_crue_web_tool/`**: This directory contains a web-based application (with its own frontend and backend) designed to facilitate the practical use of the PiaCRUE framework. It serves as a hands-on tool for generating, testing, and managing PiaCRUE prompts. Please refer to the `README.md` within this directory for specific setup and usage instructions.

*   **`img/`**: This directory stores image resources referenced by various Markdown documents within the project.

## How to Get Started

If you are new to the PiaCRUE project, you can begin your exploration with the following steps:

1.  **Understand Core Concepts**: Start by reading the [`README.md`](README.md) for a general overview and then dive into [`PiaCRUE.md`](PiaCRUE.md) to grasp the core ideas, fundamental principles, and structural framework of PiaCRUE.
2.  **Explore Practical Applications**: Next, navigate to the `Examples/` directory and the [`Examples.md`](Examples.md) file to see various prompts in action. We particularly recommend reviewing `PiaCRUE_Template.md` to understand the composition and usage of a complete PiaCRUE prompt.
3.  **Delve into Theoretical Background**: If you are interested in the theories underpinning PiaCRUE, explore the research papers and conceptual discussions in the `Papers/` directory.
4.  **Construct Your Own Prompts**: When you are ready to build your own PiaCRUE prompts, thoroughly study the prompt construction steps described in [`PiaCRUE.md`](PiaCRUE.md). You can also refer to the methodologies and advanced templates provided in the `Tools/` directory for guidance.
5.  **Experiment with the Web Tool**: For a practical, hands-on experience, explore the application in the `pia_crue_web_tool/` directory. This tool can assist you in generating, managing, and testing PiaCRUE prompts.
