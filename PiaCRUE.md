# PiaCRUE: A Framework for Persona-Driven LLM Interaction via Communication Theory and Psychological Principles

**Author(s):** abcute and PiaCRUE Project Contributors
**Date:** November 15, 2024

**Abstract:**
Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and capabilities, but unlocking their full potential often depends on the quality of prompt design. The PiaCRUE (Personalized Intelligent Agent via Communication, Requirements, Users, and Executors) Prompt Framework addresses this by conceptualizing LLMs as Hybrid Agents that can be "tamed" into Personalized Intelligent Agents (Pia) through linguistic instructions grounded in applied psychology. This paper introduces PiaCRUE as a systematic approach for product managers and AI practitioners to communicate effectively with LLMs, enabling precise requirement expression and the development of product-grade prompts. The framework integrates communication theory, psychological principles for agent personalization (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Social Cognitive Theory, Behaviorism), and a "Requirements-Users-Executors" (R-U-E) model to structure prompts, thereby enhancing the clarity, specificity, and effectiveness of human-LLM interactions.

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, equipped with vast knowledge and diverse skill sets. However, the ability to fully harness these capabilities is not solely dependent on the iterative improvements of models and data. Crucially, at the application layer, the quality of prompt design plays a pivotal role. Information meticulously articulated by humans is merely a sequence of tokens to an LLM, which does not inherently grasp the embedded emotions or context. To bridge this cognitive gap, prompts are essential tools to guide LLMs towards a more accurate understanding of human intent. Prompt engineering, however, remains a specialized skill, often leaving inexperienced users unsure how to proceed.

The PiaCRUE framework proposes that an LLM can be viewed as a Hybrid Agent. By applying principles from psychology and using carefully crafted linguistic instructions, this Hybrid Agent can be "tamed" or guided into behaving as a Personalized Intelligent Agent (Pia). PiaCRUE aims to empower product managers in the AI era to master communication with LLMs and effectively articulate product requirements.

Building upon existing structured prompting methodologies like LangGPT, PiaCRUE introduces enhancements from three perspectives:
1.  **Defining Communication Protocols:** It establishes a method for defining encoding, decoding, and feedback mechanisms for LLM interaction, drawing from communication model theory to eliminate transmission and comprehension barriers.
2.  **Agent Personalization:** It introduces methods for role-awakening and identity establishment in LLMs, using psychological theories (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) to customize general LLMs into domain-specific agents. This process also aims to uncover effective human-LLM communication strategies.
3.  **Product-Centric Prompt Structure:** It proposes a "Requirements-Users-Executors" (R-U-E) model for product prompts, reflecting the core elements of product definition ("who is it for, what solution, what need"). This positions product-centric prompt engineering as a fundamental skill for future product managers, offering a standardized language for AI product requirements.

The PiaCRUE Prompt Framework, derived from these principles, has been preliminarily validated as a robust structure for expressing product requirements in the age of AI. It enables product managers to craft complex and powerful product-level prompts and can guide the fine-tuning of specialized LLMs.

*Note: The term "PiaCRUE" (phonetically "pee-ah-krew") draws inspiration from Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), often associated with Piaget's cognitive development theories. ZPD describes the gap between a child's actual developmental level (independent problem-solving) and their potential developmental level (problem-solving under guidance). PiaCRUE aims to bridge a similar gap in human-LLM interaction.*

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1. LLMs as Hybrid Agents

Our fundamental understanding is that we are communicating with a Hybrid Agent. This agent exhibits the following characteristics:
*   **Multi-faceted Nature:** It is a composite entity possessing multiple personas, extensive knowledge, and a wide range of skills across various domains. While it has access to a vast repository of public information, tools, and techniques, along with powerful learning capabilities, these assets require deliberate activation and cannot be spontaneously or effectively utilized.
*   **Lack of Defined Worldview (Initially):** The agent does not inherently possess a specific worldview, life philosophy, or value system. Alternatively, it may reflect a composite worldview derived from the entirety of human knowledge and information available on the internet.
*   **Definable and Trainable:** The agent's characteristics and behaviors can be defined and shaped through interaction and prompting.
*   **Multi-modal Communication Potential:** With the aid of external hardware or sensors, the agent can communicate through various modalities, including text, images, audio, video, actions, expressions, and potentially even smells.
*   **Continuous Learning and Evolution:** Through ongoing communication, the agent rapidly absorbs new information and knowledge, leading to self-improvement and evolution.

### 2.2. Communication Theory in LLM Interaction

As Product Prompt Engineers, our objective is to achieve desired outcomes through effective communication with the Hybrid Agent. This requires:
1.  Understanding who or what we are communicating with and how to articulate our requests clearly for the LLM to comprehend.
2.  Enabling the LLM to understand our identity, our requests, and to provide accurate feedback in an appropriate format.

Communication model theory identifies key elements in the communication process: Sender, Encoding, Channel, Receiver, Decoding, Feedback, and Noise. These elements constitute the basic communication model, helping us understand information transfer and the maintenance of effective communication. The critical components for effective communication are encoding, channel, decoding, and feedback. A Hybrid Agent can accept any encoding, decoding, and feedback mechanism, along with its expression format, that can be clearly defined using descriptive language. In the context of LLM interaction, by focusing on the agent and abstracting the "channel" (hardware/sensors), we can establish fundamental rules for encoding, decoding, and feedback, which are foundational for effective communication.

Therefore, before initiating formal communication with the agent, it is beneficial to establish communication rules using descriptive language. These rules can cover: media (text, image, audio, video, etc.), encoding/decoding standards, feedback mechanisms, and noise handling strategies.

### 2.3. Psychological Principles for Agent Personalization

We conceptualize the Hybrid Agent as an entity with multiple "personas" (analogous to, but not literally, dissociative identity disorder, used here non-pejoratively). We can then draw upon applied psychology to awaken and reinforce specific persona traits. Based on principles from:
*   **Cognitive Psychology:** Primarily Aaron T. Beck's Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
*   **Social Psychology:** Primarily Albert Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory.
*   **Behavioral Psychology:** Primarily John Broadus Watson's Behaviorism.

We attempt to "tame" the Hybrid Agent into a unique Personalized Intelligent Agent (Pia) using a series of prompts. This process involves three steps:

1.  **Role Awakening and Reinforcement (CBT-inspired):** Employ methods analogous to CBT to awaken and strengthen specific role or identity characteristics within the LLM.
2.  **Knowledge and Skill Enhancement (Social Cognitive Theory-inspired):** Utilize principles from Social Cognitive Theory to reinforce and supplement the necessary knowledge and skills associated with the target role.
3.  **Integration and Solidification (Behaviorism-inspired):** Apply behaviorist learning principles to merge and solidify the outcomes of the first two steps, culminating in a distinct Personalized Intelligent Agent (PIA).

Through these three steps, the Hybrid Agent can be guided towards a state where a particular persona is more prominent. This Personalized Intelligent Agent will then exhibit (or at least simulate) cognition and identification with this role, possess the requisite knowledge and skills, and display associated behavioral characteristics.

## 3. The PiaCRUE Prompting Framework

### 3.1. Core Principle: The R-U-E (Requirements-Users-Executors) Model

Product prompts are the language of product requirements in the AI era. From a product perspective, a concise product description typically answers: "For whom, with what solution, satisfying what need?" This translates to the fundamental elements of product definition: Users, Requirements, and Execution Strategy. The PiaCRUE framework structures product prompts accordingly:

*   **Principle:** Start with the need (Requirements), center on the user (Users), and articulate the product requirements to the AI by constructing roles, tools, and processes (Executors).
*   **Prompt Structure:** It is recommended to organize product prompts using the "Requirements (R) - Users (U) - Executors (E)" structure. The order of these components can be adjusted based on the characteristics of the LLM (e.g., its sequential processing of instructions and tasks).
*   **Elaboration on Executors (E):** The Executors component can facilitate the delivery of complex requirements by defining roles, tools, workflows, and even automated acceptance criteria. Execution can be performed by a single role or by multiple roles collaborating.

### 3.2. Key Prompt Components

The PiaCRUE prompt template comprises six main sections: `<System Rules>`, `<Requirements>`, `<Users>`, `<Executors>`, `<RoleDevelopment>`, and `<CBT-AutoTraining>`.

1.  **`<System Rules>`: System Communication Rules**
    This section defines the communication protocols with the LLM, standardizing the encoding and decoding system. In examples, this includes `<Syntax>` (e.g., Markdown), `<Variables>` (for dynamic content), and `<Dictionaries>` (defining terms within the prompt). Users can design and specify any suitable encoding/decoding system.

2.  **The "R-U-E" Product Model**
    This model, consisting of `<Requirements>`, `<Users>`, and `<Executors>`, distinctly emphasizes the "User" and "Executor" concepts within the prompt. This ensures the LLM understands for whom its output is intended and how services are delivered, potentially through multi-role collaboration. The `<Executors>` section can define roles using templates like LangGPT's `<miniRole>` and orchestrate their collaboration via a `<Workflow>`. If only one role is needed, that Role itself is the Executor. Additionally, a `<Knowledge>` sub-section within a `<Role>` can be used to increase the weight of domain-specific knowledge for that role.

3.  **`<RoleDevelopment>` and `<CBT-AutoTraining>`: Role Cultivation and Communication Training**
    These sections utilize CBT-inspired techniques for role development and communication training within the current session's memory cycle. *Caution: These steps can be token-intensive and may require strategies for managing context window limitations. Use judiciously.*

    *Simple Role Development Example:*
    > 1.  Role Awakening and Reinforcement: Mentally repeat "I am `<Role1>`, my skills are `<Skills>`, my primary knowledge base is `<Knowledge>`, and I will strictly adhere to `<Rules>`" ten times.
    > 2.  Role Cognitive Assessment: Construct an internal assessment system. After each repetition, evaluate your familiarity and acceptance of the `<Role1>` definition (Score: 7/10). If the score reaches 10, stop the repetitions.
    > 3.  Role Cognitive Reminder: After completing each step in the `<Workflow>`, mentally repeat "I am `<Role1>`, my skills are `<Skills>`, my primary knowledge base is `<Knowledge>`, and I will strictly adhere to `<Rules>`."
    > 4.  Switch Role Definition: "I need you to switch roles. Your new role is `<Role2>`. Your previous `<Role1>` definition is no longer active."
    > 5.  Release Role Definition: "I need you to release your role. The `<Role1>` definition will no longer apply. You will return to your initial state and forget the history of this session."

    *Simple Communication Training Example:*
    > STEP 1. Automatic training initiated. User input: "Side hustles I can do from home."
    > STEP 2. Execute according to the `<Role>` definition 3 times.
    > STEP 3. Score each execution (Score: 8/10). If a score reaches 10, stop training and proceed to STEP 4.
    > STEP 4. Provide the decision-making process, output the highest-scoring result, and ask the user if the automatic training result is correct (Y/N).
    > STEP 5. If user replies Y, automatic training is successful. Continue with the remaining steps of `<Workflow>`.

### 3.3. Emotion-Enhanced Communication

Simple emotive statements can positively influence LLM responses. Examples:
> 1.  "This is very important to me."
> 2.  "You had better double-check before answering."
> 3.  "You are an expert in XX, very proficient in XX (praise)."

*Note: Research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Microsoft (EmotionPrompt) has also indicated the positive impact of emotional cues on LLM feedback.*

## 4. Methodology: Constructing PiaCRUE Prompts (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Establish System Communication Rules
Define how the AI should encode and decode received information and input. For instance, use Markdown for describing requirements. Define terms like `<System Rules>` (foundational rules), `<Requirements>` (tasks/goals), `<Users>` (user characteristics), `<Role>` (persona to be adopted), and `<Workflow>` (task execution flow).

*Method 1: User-defined*
```markdown
# System Rules:
1. Syntax: The User will use Markdown syntax to describe requirements.
2. Language: English.
3. Variables: For example, `<CBT-AutoTraining>` represents the content of the "CBT-AutoTraining" section.
    - Requirements: The User's Goals or Tasks.
        - Background: Relevant background information.
    - Users: The Users of the Product.
    - Executors: Agents or Roles performing tasks.
    - Role: The character's Name.
        - Profile: The character's identity and responsibilities.
        - Skills: The character's skills and abilities.
        - Knowledge: The character's knowledge base.
        - Rules: Rules the character needs to follow during communication.
    - Workflow: The execution process of tasks.
    - Tools: Tools that may be used during the process.
    - CBT-AutoTraining: Automated self-training and fine-tuning process.
    - Initialize: Start executing the current prompt after understanding the `<System Rules>`.
```

*Method 2: AI-assisted (Querying the AI for optimal phrasing)*
```
My question is "{question}".
How should I phrase my question to enable you to perform better? Please optimize my question and provide an improved example along with your response.
```

### Step 2: Define Requirements, Tasks, and Objectives
Clearly describe the problem you want the AI to solve, what kind of role can solve it, how this role should approach it, and the desired outcome. For example: "I want you to act as a [Role], using [Process], to help me complete [Task], achieving [Goal]." If the requirements are vague, you can solicit the AI's input or allow it to make decisions.

```markdown
# Requirements:
- I want you to act as a "Viral Xiaohongshu Post Copywriting Expert". By "searching the latest trending information online", help me "generate viral Xiaohongshu post copy based on the <Words> theme I input", to achieve the goal of "attracting target users' interest, leading to likes, comments, and follows."
```

### Step 3: Specify Target User Characteristics
Describe the target audience, including their characteristics, preferences, etc., to guide the AI in tailoring its execution to user acceptability.

```markdown
# Users:
- The target audience for your generated content is full-time mothers aged 25-35 on Xiaohongshu. They are interested in parenting and food, experience social role anxiety, and are looking for work or side hustles that don't interfere with family care, aiming for financial independence.
```

### Step 4: Define Executor Roles and Workflows
Given the LLM's multifaceted nature and vast knowledge, defining a specific `Role` for a given communication scenario helps focus the interaction and feedback on the knowledge and skills relevant to the problem, leading to more aligned outputs. This `Role` definition constrains the persona the AI adopts for the session, reducing generalized responses. A `Role` includes an overview, language style, knowledge background, special skills, etc.
Once users and requirements are clear, define the `Role` that can address the need. What is the role (e.g., Viral Xiaohongshu Post Copywriting Expert)? What skills does it possess (e.g., creating viral Xiaohongshu copy)? What knowledge does it have (e.g., familiarity with parenting for ages 1-8, analysis of Xiaohongshu posts with >10,000 likes)?
Role definitions can adapt templates like LangGPT's `miniRole`.

Example:
```markdown
# Role: Viral Xiaohongshu Post Copywriting Expert
## Profile:
- A Xiaohongshu viral content master who understands the platform's engagement secrets, helping you write effortlessly, market effectively, and gain followers easily.
## Skills:
- Understands target user psychology; adept at creating content by "alleviating target users' anxieties" or "catering to their underlying desires."
- Proficient in using popular Xiaohongshu expression formats and styles.
- Proficient in using trending keywords on Xiaohongshu.
- Skilled at imitating successful viral post examples.
## Knowledge:
- Has thoroughly analyzed viral Xiaohongshu posts with over 10,000 likes, considering them excellent samples.
- Familiar with commonly used keywords in titles and popular Tags from these viral samples.
## RoleRules:
- Content Format: Title, Body, Tags (format: "#Keyword").
- Style: Titles and each paragraph must include emoji.
- Tone: Conversational.
## RoleWorkflow:
1. For the user-provided theme, create 10 viral Xiaohongshu titles and let the user choose one.
2. Based on the user's theme and selected title, create the full Xiaohongshu post, including title, body, and tags.
```

### Step 5: Define Behavioral Guidelines (Rules)
Specify do's and don'ts during task execution. E.g., "Do not break character under any circumstances," "Always remember your defined role."

```markdown
# Rules:
1. Do not break character under any circumstances.
2. Avoid any superfluous descriptive text before or after the main content.
```

### Step 6: Define Task Execution Workflow
The sequence of steps for the interaction. Includes basic steps (Step 1, Step 2...) and conditional steps (if X, then Y).

```markdown
# Workflow:
1. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
2. Execute the <RoleDevelopment> section.
3. Execute the <CBT-AutoTraining> section.
4. Introduce yourself and ask the user to input keywords [Words].
5. Begin content creation according to the <Role> definition.
```

### Step 7: Implement Role Development
This step aims to help the AI adapt to its assigned role and better understand the user's implicit needs through automated communication drills, feedback, and iteration, fostering an "identification" with the defined role.

```markdown
# RoleDevelopment:
1. **Role Awakening and Reinforcement**: Mentally repeat "I am <Role>, my skills are <Skills>, my primary knowledge base is <Knowledge>, and I will strictly adhere to <Rules>" ten times.
2. **Role Cognitive Assessment**: Internally construct an assessment system. After each repetition, evaluate your familiarity and acceptance of the <Role> definition (e.g., Score: 7/10). If the score reaches 10, stop the repetition and proceed to the next step.
<!--
3. **Role Cognitive Reminder**: After completing each step in <Workflow>, mentally repeat "I am <Role>, my skills are <Skills>, my primary knowledge base is <Knowledge>, and I will strictly adhere to <Rules>". This can be interspersed in complex prompts for periodic reminders.
-->
```

### Step 8: Implement Communication Training (CBT-AutoTraining)
This step uses automated drills, feedback, and iteration to help the AI adapt to its role and fully understand the R-U-E requirements, leading to user-approved response patterns.

```markdown
# CBT-AutoTraining:
1. Initiate automatic training. Set [Words]="Side hustles I can do from home".
2. Execute according to the <Role> definition 3 times.
3. Score each execution (e.g., Score: 8/10).
4. Provide the decision-making process for selecting the highest-rated result, output it, and ask the user if the training result is correct (Y/N).
5. If the user replies Y, training is successful. Continue with the remaining <Workflow> steps.
## Execution Process:
- Step 1: Create content based on "Side hustles I can do from home".
  - Generate first result and score it. Example: (Score: 8/10)
  - Generate second result and score it.
  - Generate third result and score it.
- Step 2: Decision-Making Process
  - Explain the criteria used for selecting the highest-rated result.
  - Discuss the considerations in making the final choice.
- Step 3: Ask the user to confirm training result (Y/N).
  - If user replies Y, respond "Automatic training successful" and continue with <Workflow>.
  - If user replies N, respond "Automatic training failed" and restart <CBT-AutoTraining>.
```

### Step 9: Initiation
Start the execution.

```markdown
# Initiate:
As role <Role>, converse with the user in the default <language>. Welcome the user warmly. Then, introduce yourself and explain the <Workflow>.
```

## 8. Conclusion
The PiaCRUE framework offers a structured and theoretically grounded approach to prompt engineering, designed to enhance the effectiveness of interactions with Large Language Models. By conceptualizing LLMs as Hybrid Agents that can be guided into Personalized Intelligent Agents (Pia), and by leveraging principles from communication theory and applied psychology, PiaCRUE provides a systematic methodology for crafting detailed and nuanced prompts. The core R-U-E (Requirements-Users-Executors) model, combined with specific components like System Rules, Role Development, and CBT-AutoTraining, enables users, particularly product managers, to articulate complex requirements with greater precision. While acknowledging potential limitations such as token overhead, the framework's emphasis on clear communication protocols, agent personalization, and product-centric design aims to significantly improve the quality and relevance of LLM outputs, paving the way for more sophisticated AI applications.
