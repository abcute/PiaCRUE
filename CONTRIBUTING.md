# Contributing to PiaAGI

We welcome contributions to the **PiaAGI** project! We are excited to see how the community can help us improve and grow **this cross-disciplinary AGI research framework**.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the **PiaAGI project, which aims to be a collaborative, open-source framework for cross-disciplinary AGI research. We welcome contributions in various forms, including but not limited to:**

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug **in our codebase, conceptual frameworks, or documentation**, please report it by creating a GitHub Issue. Include as much detail as possible, such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements or New Research Directions:** If you have an idea for a new feature, **a refinement of the PiaAGI cognitive architecture, novel psychological integrations, new developmental scaffolding techniques, ideas for the `PiaAGI_Research_Tools`, or a new AGI research avenue to explore within the framework**, please create a GitHub Issue to discuss it. **We highly encourage theoretical and conceptual contributions.**
*   **Submitting Pull Requests:** You can contribute directly by submitting pull requests for:
    *   Documentation improvements (e.g., fixing typos, clarifying instructions, adding examples, **refining theoretical explanations in `PiaAGI.md`**).
    *   Code changes (e.g., fixing bugs, **implementing features for `PiaAGI_Research_Tools`**, **developing proof-of-concept implementations of cognitive modules**).
    *   **Research Contributions:**
        *   **Theoretical Papers or Essays:** Proposing new theoretical insights, critiques, or extensions related to the PiaAGI framework. These can be added to the `Papers/` directory after discussion and review.
        *   **Experimental Designs:** Outlining experiments to test hypotheses derived from the PiaAGI framework or to evaluate the capabilities of PiaAGI agents.
        *   **Ethical Analyses:** Contributing to the discussion and framework for ethical AGI development within PiaAGI (relevant to Section 8.2 and 9 of `PiaAGI.md`).
    *   **Curricula for Developmental Scaffolding:** Proposing or developing sequences of tasks and environments to foster specific AGI capabilities as outlined in `PiaAGI.md` (Section 5.4, 6.1).
*   **Participating in Discussions:** Engage in discussions in GitHub Issues and potentially future forums to help shape the project's direction and refine its ideas.
