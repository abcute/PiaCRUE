# Legacy Conceptual Tools and Methodologies

**This directory is now considered LEGACY and contains conceptual and methodological documents from earlier phases of the PiaAGI project.**

While these documents offer insights into the project's evolution, for the most current and practical tools, AGI-focused methodologies, and prompt templates, please refer to:

*   **Main AGI Framework & Prompt Templates:** **[`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md)** (especially Appendix B for the Guiding Prompt Template)
*   **Current Research Tools & Implementations:** **[`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/)** directory.

**Important Note:** The items in this directory are **not** executable software packages or standalone applications. They are guiding frameworks, detailed methodologies, and sophisticated prompt structures intended for archival study and adaptation.

## Legacy Documents Retained:

*   **[`AutoExpGPT.md`](AutoExpGPT.md):** Outlines a conceptual framework and methodology for the automated experimentation and evaluation of prompt strategy effectiveness. This is retained for its methodological insights.

*   **[`PiaAGI_Prompt_Generator.md`](PiaAGI_Prompt_Generator.md):** Describes a conceptual methodology for generating PiaAGI prompt templates using a "DeepInception-like" approach.
    *   **Note:** For a comprehensive, ready-to-use AGI prompt template, please see **Appendix B of [`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md)**.
    *   For current programmatic prompt engineering tools and suites, please explore the **[`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/`](../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/)** directory.

Please refer to each document for detailed explanations of its conceptual methodology.
