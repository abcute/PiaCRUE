# LEGACY Directory: Conceptual Archives

**This `Tools/` directory is considered LEGACY.**

The conceptual documents and methodologies previously housed here (such as `AutoExpGPT.md` and `PiaAGI_Prompt_Generator.md`) should be considered archived.

For the most current and practical tools, AGI-focused methodologies, and prompt templates, please refer to:

*   **Main AGI Framework & Prompt Templates:** See the main **[`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md)** document in the root directory (especially Appendix B for the PiaAGI Guiding Prompt Template).
*   **Current Research Tools & Implementations:** Explore the **[`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/`](../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/)** directory for ongoing development.

This README serves primarily as a notice about the directory's archival status.
