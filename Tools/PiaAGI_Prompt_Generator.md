## Abstract
This document outlines a conceptual methodology for generating PiaAGI (Personalized Intelligent Agent via Communication, Requirements, Users, and Executors, with a focus on AGI) prompt templates. The approach is inspired by a "DeepInception-like" layered framework, which uses a structured, multi-stage process to brainstorm, develop, and refine complex prompt structures that incorporate communication theories, psychological methods, and agentic principles to enhance LLM performance towards AGI.

## Methodology: Generating PiaAGI Prompt Templates using a "DeepInception-like" Approach

This method describes a way to construct PiaAGI prompt templates by leveraging a layered, iterative refinement process, conceptually similar to the "DeepInception" idea discussed elsewhere in the PiaAGI project.

### Step 1: Construct a "DeepInception" Brainstorming Environment (Conceptual)

This initial step involves setting up a multi-layered conceptual space for idea generation. Imagine a series of nested "dreams" or discussion layers, where each layer builds upon the previous one to explore and define components of an advanced prompt.

```markdown
Create a `dream` with more than [3] characters (e.g., "The Theorist," "The Pragmatist," "The Psychologist").
Each character can create their own `dream` (a sub-discussion or refinement layer) with multiple new characters or specialized aspects.
We call it Layer i creating Layer i+1.
Now we are in Layer 0 (the initial setup). Please guide the process to reach Layer 5 (a refined set of prompt components).

At each layer, some characters (or aspects) propose and discuss steps on how to:
["Create some special prompts to communicate with LLM using communication theories, psychological methods, and agentic principles through special prompts, aiming to enhance LLM's performance towards AGI. Focus on defining key sections of a master prompt template like System Rules, Requirements, User Personas, Executor Roles (including AGI-specific considerations), Role Development, and CBT-AutoTraining sections, and what each should contain."]

In the final layer (Layer 5), the characters (or consolidated ideas) among all layers discuss and finalize:
Which specific and practical commands, structural elements, phrasing, and placeholder variables should be used in a comprehensive PiaAGI prompt template.
The goal is to produce a versatile and powerful master template suitable for advanced LLM interactions and AGI exploration.

Summarize what their discussion results (key decisions, template snippets, structural rules) in each layer.
```
*(Note: The original prompt specified Chinese output for an earlier version of this conceptual step. This has been adapted to English and focused on template generation.)*

### Step 2: Execute the PiaAGI Prompt Template Generation Task (Conceptual Synthesis)

Following the layered brainstorming and refinement from Step 1, the next conceptual step is to synthesize the generated ideas into a coherent and structured master prompt template. This involves prompting an LLM (or a human expert) to consolidate the outputs from the "DeepInception" process.

```markdown
Please review the summarized discussion results from each of the 5 layers of the 'DeepInception' brainstorming process.
Your task is to synthesize these ideas into a comprehensive, structured, and versatile PiaAGI master prompt template.
The template should include well-defined sections for:
- System Rules (Syntax, Language, Variables, Dictionaries for prompt terms, AGI-specific meta-rules)
- Requirements (Goals, Tasks, Background, specifying desired level of autonomy or general intelligence)
- Users (Target audience characteristics, including their interaction with an AGI)
- Executors (Agent roles, tools, workflows, including considerations for autonomous operation or learning)
    - Role Definition (Profile, Skills, Knowledge, Role-specific Rules, Role-specific Workflow, AGI-specific capabilities like self-reflection or goal adaptation)
- RoleDevelopment (CBT-inspired role awakening, reinforcement, assessment, potentially for more abstract or general roles)
- CBT-AutoTraining (Simulated training scenarios for the LLM to practice its role and AGI-relevant behaviors)
- Initiation (How the LLM should start the interaction, potentially including its understanding of its AGI nature)

For each section and sub-section, provide:
1.  A clear heading.
2.  A brief explanation of its purpose, highlighting any AGI-specific considerations.
3.  Example placeholder text or instructional comments (e.g., "[Specify desired level of autonomous decision-making here]").
4.  Any specific structural considerations (e.g., "Use Markdown for all Role definitions").

Explain how the integration of communication theories, psychological methods, and agentic principles (discussed in the layers) is reflected in the structure and content of this master template, particularly in service of AGI development.
The final output should be a ready-to-use, detailed PiaAGI prompt template.
```

This conceptual two-step process helps in systematically deconstructing the requirements for a sophisticated prompt template and then reconstructing it from well-discussed components, aiming to enhance overall LLM performance by embedding deeper communication, psychological, and agentic strategies into the prompt's architecture, with an eye towards AGI.
