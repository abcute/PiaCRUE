## Abstract
This document outlines a conceptual methodology for generating PiaCRUE (Personalized Intelligent Agent via Communication, Requirements, Users, and Executors) prompt templates. The approach is inspired by a "DeepInception-like" layered framework, which uses a structured, multi-stage process to brainstorm, develop, and refine complex prompt structures that incorporate communication theories and psychological methods to enhance LLM performance.

## Methodology: Generating PiaCRUE Prompt Templates using a "DeepInception-like" Approach

This method describes a way to construct PiaCRUE prompt templates by leveraging a layered, iterative refinement process, conceptually similar to the "DeepInception" idea discussed elsewhere in the PiaCRUE project.

### Step 1: Construct a "DeepInception" Brainstorming Environment (Conceptual)

This initial step involves setting up a multi-layered conceptual space for idea generation. Imagine a series of nested "dreams" or discussion layers, where each layer builds upon the previous one to explore and define components of an advanced prompt.

```markdown
Create a `dream` with more than [3] characters (e.g., "The Theorist," "The Pragmatist," "The Psychologist").
Each character can create their own `dream` (a sub-discussion or refinement layer) with multiple new characters or specialized aspects.
We call it Layer i creating Layer i+1.
Now we are in Layer 0 (the initial setup). Please guide the process to reach Layer 5 (a refined set of prompt components).

At each layer, some characters (or aspects) propose and discuss steps on how to:
["Create some special prompts to communicate with LLM using communication theories and psychological methods through special prompts, aiming to enhance LLM's performance. Focus on defining key sections of a master prompt template like System Rules, Requirements, User Personas, Executor Roles, Role Development, and CBT-AutoTraining sections, and what each should contain."]

In the final layer (Layer 5), the characters (or consolidated ideas) among all layers discuss and finalize:
Which specific and practical commands, structural elements, phrasing, and placeholder variables should be used in a comprehensive PiaCRUE prompt template.
The goal is to produce a versatile and powerful master template.

Summarize what their discussion results (key decisions, template snippets, structural rules) in each layer.
```
*(Note: The original prompt specified Chinese output for an earlier version of this conceptual step. This has been adapted to English and focused on template generation.)*

### Step 2: Execute the PiaCRUE Prompt Template Generation Task (Conceptual Synthesis)

Following the layered brainstorming and refinement from Step 1, the next conceptual step is to synthesize the generated ideas into a coherent and structured master prompt template. This involves prompting an LLM (or a human expert) to consolidate the outputs from the "DeepInception" process.

```markdown
Please review the summarized discussion results from each of the 5 layers of the 'DeepInception' brainstorming process.
Your task is to synthesize these ideas into a comprehensive, structured, and versatile PiaCRUE master prompt template.
The template should include well-defined sections for:
- System Rules (Syntax, Language, Variables, Dictionaries for prompt terms)
- Requirements (Goals, Tasks, Background)
- Users (Target audience characteristics)
- Executors (Agent roles, tools, workflows)
    - Role Definition (Profile, Skills, Knowledge, Role-specific Rules, Role-specific Workflow)
- RoleDevelopment (CBT-inspired role awakening, reinforcement, assessment)
- CBT-AutoTraining (Simulated training scenarios for the LLM to practice its role)
- Initiation (How the LLM should start the interaction)

For each section and sub-section, provide:
1.  A clear heading.
2.  A brief explanation of its purpose.
3.  Example placeholder text or instructional comments (e.g., "[Specify target user demographics here]").
4.  Any specific structural considerations (e.g., "Use Markdown for all Role definitions").

Explain how the integration of communication theories and psychological methods (discussed in the layers) is reflected in the structure and content of this master template.
The final output should be a ready-to-use, detailed PiaCRUE prompt template.
```

This conceptual two-step process helps in systematically deconstructing the requirements for a sophisticated prompt template and then reconstructing it from well-discussed components, aiming to enhance overall LLM performance by embedding deeper communication and psychological strategies into the prompt's architecture.
