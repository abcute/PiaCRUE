# PiaAGI Framework: AGI-Focused Examples

Welcome to the PiaAGI Examples directory! This section provides practical illustrations and templates to help you understand and apply the **PiaAGI AGI Research Framework**. While the main [`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md) document contains core AGI-specific examples (Section 7) and foundational R-U-E prompting examples (Appendix A), this directory offers supplementary materials.

The examples here aim to provide:

*   **Detailed Deep-Dives:** Focused explorations into configuring specific aspects of the PiaAGI psycho-cognitive architecture (e.g., Self-Model, Motivational System, Personality) as outlined in `PiaAGI.md` (Section 4).
*   **Practical Templates:** Starting points for users wishing to experiment with "Guiding Prompts" to shape an agent's cognitive setup.
*   **Illustrations of Core Principles:** Concrete examples of applying PiaAGI concepts like introductory developmental scaffolding or initiating tool understanding.
*   **Conceptual Use of PiaPES:** Insights into how the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) (see [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/`](../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/)) can be used to construct and manage these advanced prompts.

## How to Use These Examples

*   **Contextual Learning:** Always refer to the main [`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md) document to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the concepts demonstrated in these examples. Pay close attention to Sections 3 (Core Psychological Principles), 4 (Cognitive Architecture), 5 (Prompting Framework), and 6 (Methodology).
*   **Experimentation:** Adapt and test these examples in environments that can interpret PiaAGI's structured prompts. Observe how changes in prompt structure and content influence the conceptualized agent's behavior and internal states.
*   **Building Blocks:** Use these examples as inspiration or foundational templates for developing your own sophisticated Guiding Prompts and Developmental Scaffolding curricula for PiaAGI agents.

## Example Categories

This directory will be structured to include examples in categories such as:

1.  **Cognitive Module Configuration:**
    *   Detailed prompts for setting up and tuning specific cognitive modules (e.g., `Configuring_Motivational_System.md`, `Setting_Personality_Profile.md`).
2.  **Introductory Developmental Scaffolding:**
    *   Examples of Guiding Prompts that initiate early-stage developmental processes (e.g., `Scaffolding_Basic_ToM.md` for Theory of Mind development).
3.  **Initiating Tool Use and Understanding:**
    *   Prompts designed to introduce conceptual tools to an agent and guide its initial interactions with them (e.g., `Introducing_Conceptual_Tools.md`).
4.  **PiaPES Usage (Conceptual):**
    *   Illustrations of how the PiaPES prompt engine could be used to programmatically build and manage complex PiaAGI prompts (e.g., `Building_A_Role_Prompt_With_PiaPES.md`).

*(This list will be expanded as more examples are developed.)*

## A Note on PiaCRUE

The PiaAGI framework is an evolution of the earlier PiaCRUE methodology. While PiaCRUE focused on enhancing LLM interaction through structured prompting, PiaAGI significantly expands this scope to address core AGI research challenges with a psycho-cognitively plausible architecture. Foundational R-U-E prompting examples, which originated with PiaCRUE, can now be found in Appendix A of [`PiaAGI.md`](../PiaAGI.md).
