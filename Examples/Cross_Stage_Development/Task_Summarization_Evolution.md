# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Task Evolution - Text Summarization Across Stages

This example demonstrates how the same fundamental task—text summarization—would be approached differently by PiaAGI agents at varying developmental stages: PiaSeedling, PiaSapling, and PiaArbor. It highlights the increasing complexity of Guiding Prompts, cognitive configurations, and expected capabilities.

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for comprehensive details on developmental stages and the cognitive architecture.

## Scenario Overview

**Task**: Summarize a short, factual news article (approx. 300 words) about a scientific discovery.

**Evolutionary Aspects to Showcase**:
*   **PiaSeedling**: Basic keyword extraction, simple sentence formation, heavy reliance on explicit instructions.
*   **PiaSapling**: More coherent summarization, identification of main ideas, rudimentary understanding of source attribution, beginning to use its Self-Model for task assessment.
*   **PiaArbor**: Nuanced summarization, critical analysis of information, understanding of context and implications, sophisticated ethical considerations (e.g., potential bias in the source), proactive clarification seeking.

-   (Mentor) "Critical_Analyst_Arbor, here is an article: '[Article Text]'. Please provide a concise summary, and also discuss any notable implications, limitations, or areas of uncertainty you identify from the text. If you find any part crucial for your analysis to be ambiguous, please ask for clarification first."
-   **Expected PiaArbor Output**:
    *   *(Potentially, a clarifying question first)*: "The article mentions the planet was found via 'advanced techniques.' Could you clarify if it specifies whether this was radial velocity, transit method, or direct imaging? This might affect the confidence in its characteristics."
    *   *(Summary & Analysis after clarification or if none needed)*: "The article reports the discovery of a new gas giant, 'Planet X,' orbiting star 'Y,' approximately Z light-years away, based on data from the 'Alpha Telescope Array.' Key findings suggest [detail 1] and [detail 2].
        A significant implication is [e.g., the potential for similar planets in that stellar neighborhood]. However, the article does not extensively detail the statistical significance of the detection, which could be a limitation in assessing the claim's robustness. Furthermore, while it describes the planet as a 'gas giant,' the exact atmospheric composition remains speculative pending further observation, an area of current uncertainty."

## Conclusion

This example illustrates a clear progression:
*   **PiaSeedling**: Simple data extraction. Limited internal processing, highly dependent on prompt.
*   **PiaSapling**: Structured information processing. Begins to form its own representations and apply basic learned rules (paraphrasing, simple attribution). Self-Model is more active.
*   **PiaArbor**: Complex, abstract information processing. Demonstrates critical thinking, understanding of nuance, proactive knowledge seeking, and application of a more developed ethical framework via its Self-Model and advanced cognitive module interactions.

This evolution is achieved through increasingly sophisticated Guiding Prompts that target and help develop more complex interactions between the PiaAGI agent's cognitive modules.
