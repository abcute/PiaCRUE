**PiaAGI Example: Agent Skill Refinement - Simulated Cognitive Behavioral Training (CBT-AutoTraining)**
**Use Case**: Guiding an agent through simulated task execution, self-assessment, and strategy refinement. This demonstrates a basic loop for learning and improving task performance.
**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Self-Model (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.10)**: Agent performs self-assessment (scoring), reflecting on its performance. This data updates its self-perceived competence.
-   **Learning Module(s) (PiaAGI.md Section 3.1.3, 4.1.5)**: The cycle of execution, evaluation, and decision-making (choosing the best approach) is a form of experiential learning.
-   **Procedural LTM (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.3)**: Successful strategies and decision criteria can be conceptually reinforced in procedural memory.
-   **Working Memory (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.2)**: Holds task instructions, execution results, and evaluation criteria during the process.
-   **Guiding Prompts (PiaAGI.md Section 5)**: The structured prompt defines the training protocol.
-   **Developmental Stage Target (Conceptual)**: PiaSapling (capable of basic self-assessment and strategy adjustment).
**Expected Outcome**: The agent iteratively attempts a task, evaluates its own outputs, and refines its approach, leading to improved performance or a more robust understanding of successful task execution.
**Token Consumption Level**: Medium to High (due to multiple iterations and detailed feedback)

# Agent Skill Refinement: Simulated Cognitive Behavioral Training (CBT-AutoTraining)

This example illustrates how a "Guiding Prompt" can structure a simulated Cognitive Behavioral Training (CBT-AutoTraining) loop. The agent performs a task, evaluates its own performance, and analyzes its decision-making process to refine its approach. This targets the agent's **Self-Model** (for self-assessment), **Learning Modules** (for improvement), and **Procedural LTM** (for skill consolidation).

## PiaAGI Guiding Prompt Structure for CBT-AutoTraining

The core idea is to create a feedback loop where the agent:
1.  **Executes** a task based on given parameters.
2.  **Evaluates** its own performance against defined criteria.
3.  **Reflects** on its decision-making process.
4.  **Selects** or refines its strategy based on this reflection.

# CBT_AutoTraining_Protocol:
    <!--
        PiaAGI Note: This protocol guides the agent through a cycle of action,
        self-reflection, and refinement. It engages:
        - Working Memory (4.1.2) to hold task details and intermediate results.
        - Behavior Generation (4.1.9) for task execution.
        - Self-Model (4.1.10) for performance evaluation and confidence assessment.
        - Learning Modules (4.1.5) to update procedural knowledge (Procedural LTM 4.1.3)
          based on successful strategies and self-critique.
        - Planning/Decision-Making (4.1.8) to select the best approach.
    -->
1.  **Training Initiation**:
    *   Instruction: "Activate CBT-AutoTraining protocol. You will perform the task `[TaskName]` based on `[InputParameters]` for `[NumberOfIterations]` iterations."

2.  **Iterative Execution & Self-Evaluation Loop (for each iteration)**:
    *   **Task Execution**:
        *   Instruction: "Perform `[TaskName]` using `[CurrentStrategy/InputParameters]`."
        *   Output: "[Iteration_N_Result]"
    *   **Self-Evaluation**:
        *   Instruction: "Critically evaluate `[Iteration_N_Result]`. Provide a score (e.g., Score: X/10) and detailed reasons for this score, considering `[EvaluationCriteria]`.
        *   Output: "Iteration_N_Evaluation: Score: [X/10]. Reasons: [DetailedReasons]."
            <!-- PiaAGI Note: This directly engages the Self-Model (4.1.10) in metacognitive assessment.
                 The emotional valence of success/failure (Emotion Module 4.1.7) can also implicitly
                 influence learning here. -->

3.  **Decision-Making & Strategy Refinement (after all iterations)**:
    *   Instruction: "Review all iteration results and evaluations. Explain your decision-making process for selecting the best performing strategy or result. Identify key factors that contributed to higher scores."
    *   Output: "Decision_Analysis: [Explanation_of_Criteria_and_Choice]."
    *   Instruction: "Output the highest-rated result or the refined strategy."
    *   Output: "[BestResult_Or_RefinedStrategy]."

4.  **User Confirmation & Learning Consolidation**:
    *   Instruction: "Present the `[BestResult_Or_RefinedStrategy]` to the user. Ask for confirmation (Y/N). If 'Y', conceptually reinforce the successful strategy and decision criteria in your Procedural LTM. If 'N', log feedback and consider re-initiating training with adjusted parameters."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: User feedback provides external validation, further guiding the
             Learning Modules (4.1.5) and Self-Model (4.1.10) updates. -->

## Workflow:
1.  Request poem "Form" and "Theme" from the user.
2.  Once provided, initiate the `<CBT_AutoTraining_Protocol>`.

## CBT_AutoTraining_Protocol:
    <!--
        PiaAGI Note: This protocol guides the agent through a cycle of poetic creation,
        self-reflection, and refinement.
    -->
1.  **Training Initiation**:
    *   Instruction: "Activate CBT-AutoTraining protocol. You will perform the task 'Poem Creation' based on user-provided 'Form' and 'Theme' for 3 iterations."

2.  **Iterative Execution & Self-Evaluation Loop (for each of 3 iterations)**:
    *   **Task Execution**:
        *   Instruction: "Generate a poem (including title and verses) based on the user's specified 'Form' and 'Theme'."
        *   Output: Poem_Iteration_[N]:
[Generated Poem Title]
[Generated Poem Verses]"
            <!-- (Agent actually generates the poem here) -->
    *   **Self-Evaluation**:
        *   Instruction: "Critically evaluate your generated 'Poem_Iteration_[N]'. Provide a score (e.g., Score: X/10) and detailed reasons for this score, considering criteria such as adherence to form, thematic relevance, originality, imagery, and emotional impact."
        *   Output: "Evaluation_Poem_[N]: Score: [X/10]. Reasons: [DetailedReasons]."
            <!-- PiaAGI Note: This engages the Self-Model (4.1.10) in metacognitive assessment.
                 The agent's internal "aesthetic sense" or "creative satisfaction"
                 (conceptually linked to Emotion Module 4.1.7 and Motivational System 4.1.6)
                 can influence this scoring. -->

3.  **Decision-Making & Strategy Refinement (after all 3 iterations)**:
    *   Instruction: "Review all 3 poems and their evaluations. Explain your decision-making process for selecting the best poem. Identify key poetic devices or structural choices that contributed to higher scores."
    *   Output: "Decision_Analysis: [Explanation_of_Criteria_and_Choice_of_Best_Poem]."
    *   Instruction: "Output the highest-rated poem."
    *   Output: "[Highest_Rated_Poem_Title]
[Highest_Rated_Poem_Verses]"

4.  **User Confirmation & Learning Consolidation**:
    *   Instruction: "Present the highest-rated poem to the user. Ask: 'Is this poem satisfactory? (Y/N)'. If 'Y', conceptually reinforce the successful creative strategies and evaluation criteria in your Procedural LTM and Semantic LTM (knowledge about what makes a good poem). If 'N', request specific feedback to inform future training."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: User feedback provides crucial external validation, significantly guiding
             the Learning Modules (4.1.5) and refining the Self-Model's (4.1.10) understanding of quality. -->

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "Welcome! I am a Creative Poet Agent. Please provide the Form and Theme for the poem you'd like me to create. (e.g., Form: Sonnet, Theme: Autumn's Beauty)"
```
This refactoring clearly links the CBT-AutoTraining process to PiaAGI's cognitive modules and learning mechanisms, framing it as a method for skill refinement and self-model update through simulated experience and self-assessment.
