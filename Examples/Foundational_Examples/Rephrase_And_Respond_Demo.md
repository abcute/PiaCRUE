**PiaAGI Foundational Example: Rephrase-and-Respond for Improved Query Comprehension**

**Use Case**: Demonstrating the "One-step Rephrase-and-Respond" technique to ensure an agent better understands a user's potentially ambiguous or complex query before providing an answer.

**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Query Comprehension**: Aiding the agent in accurately interpreting user intent.
-   **Effective Communication (PiaAGI.md Section 2.2)**: Enhancing clarity in the communication process.
-   **Perception Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.1)**: The initial processing of the query and its rephrased version.
-   **Working Memory (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.2)**: Holding and comparing the original and rephrased query.
-   **Reference**: Based on the Rephrase-and-Respond (RaR) method by Gu et al. (see `Papers/Rephrase-and-Respond.md`).

**Expected Outcome**: The agent first rephrases and expands on the user's question to confirm its understanding of all parts and nuances. Then, it provides the answer to this clarified, rephrased question.

**Token Consumption Level**: Medium to High (due to rephrasing and then answering).

# Foundational Technique: Rephrase-and-Respond for Clarity

The "Rephrase-and-Respond" (RaR) technique, as detailed in **`Papers/Rephrase-and-Respond.md`** (based on research by Gu et al.), is a prompting strategy where an LLM is instructed to first rephrase and expand on a given question before providing an answer. This helps the LLM (and the user) confirm a shared understanding of the query, especially if it's complex or ambiguous, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.

This example demonstrates the "One-step RaR" approach.

## PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Using One-Step Rephrase-and-Respond

```markdown
# System_Rules:
-   Language: English
-   PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Execute_Immediate

# Requirements:
-   Goal: To accurately answer the user's query after first rephrasing and expanding it to ensure full comprehension.
-   User_Query: "Can you tell me about the main effects of climate change on agriculture and global food supply, particularly looking at challenges in developing nations over the past decade, and also what are some potential future adaptation strategies being discussed?"
-   Agent_Instruction: "Before you answer the User_Query, please rephrase and expand it to ensure you've captured all its components and nuances. After presenting your rephrased question, provide a comprehensive answer to that rephrased version."

    <!--
        PiaAGI Note for the Human Reader:
        The core instruction guides the agent to perform a two-part response.
        1. Rephrase/Expand: This step forces the agent to process the original query
           deeply, identify its key components, and articulate its understanding.
           This is crucial for the agent's internal "Perception" (4.1.1) and
           "Working Memory" (4.1.2) to build an accurate representation of the task.
        2. Answer: The subsequent answer is based on this clarified understanding,
           leading to higher relevance and accuracy.

## Explanation of the Example:

1.  **Complex User Query**: The `User_Query` is intentionally multi-faceted, covering effects, specific regions, a timeframe, and future strategies, making it a good candidate for RaR.
2.  **Explicit RaR Instruction**: The `Agent_Instruction` clearly directs the agent to first rephrase/expand, then answer the rephrased version.
3.  **Enhanced Comprehension**: The rephrasing step acts as a check for the agent's **Perception Module (4.1.1)** and helps solidify the query's representation in **Working Memory (4.1.2)**. It allows the user to implicitly confirm if the agent has understood the query correctly before a detailed answer is generated.
4.  **Improved Answer Quality**: By answering the more detailed, self-clarified question, the agent is more likely to address all aspects of the original query comprehensively.

**Expected Response Structure:**

The agent's response should follow this pattern:

```
Okay, I will first rephrase and expand your question to ensure I've understood it correctly, and then I will answer that rephrased question.

Rephrased and Expanded Question:
"You are asking for a detailed analysis of the primary impacts of climate change on agricultural practices and the overall global food supply. Specifically, you're interested in the challenges faced by developing countries in this context over the last ten years (approximately 2014-2024). Furthermore, you want to know about potential future adaptation strategies that are currently being discussed or proposed to mitigate these effects."

Now, here is my answer to the rephrased question:
[Comprehensive answer addressing all parts of the rephrased question: impacts on agriculture, global food supply, specific challenges in developing nations in the last decade, and future adaptation strategies...]
```

This example demonstrates how the Rephrase-and-Respond technique can be a valuable tool for ensuring clarity and accuracy in AI interactions, aligning with PiaAGI's emphasis on effective communication.
