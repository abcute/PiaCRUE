# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Configuring the Learning Module(s)

This example demonstrates how specific parameters within the `<Cognitive_Module_Configuration>` block of a Guiding Prompt can be used to set up an agent's Learning Module(s). This configuration influences how the agent acquires new knowledge, refines skills, adapts its internal models (like the World Model or Self-Model), and evolves its ethical framework.

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for detailed explanations of the Learning Module(s) and their role in the cognitive architecture.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for general interaction, YAML for specific config blocks.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Natural language explanation of configured learning strategy.
# 4. Logging_Level: Detailed_Module_Trace (for observing learning module activity and parameter updates)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Execute_Immediate (apply configuration)
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:

## Key Configuration Parameters for the Learning Module(s)

This example highlights the following conceptual parameters within `Learning_Module_Config`:

*   **`Primary_Learning_Mode` / `Secondary_Learning_Mode`**: Specifies the main and auxiliary learning paradigms the agent should employ (e.g., `SupervisedLearning_From_Feedback`, `ReinforcementLearning_From_RewardSignal`, `UnsupervisedLearning_Concept_Discovery`, `ObservationalLearning_From_Demonstration`). An agent might use multiple modes concurrently or switch between them.
*   **`Learning_Rate_Initial`**: The starting learning rate for algorithms that use one.
*   **`Learning_Rate_Adaptation_Rule`**: Defines how the learning rate changes over time or based on performance (e.g., `Fixed`, `Annealing_Schedule`, `Reduce_On_Plateau`, `Adaptive_Based_On_Prediction_Error`).
*   **`Knowledge_Integration_Strategy`**: How newly acquired information or skills are integrated into Long-Term Memory (LTM) (e.g., `Immediate_Overwrite`, `Incremental_Consolidation_To_LTM`, `Dual_Memory_Fast_Slow_Integration`).
*   **`Ethical_Heuristic_Update_Mechanism`**:
    *   **`Type`**: The method used to update ethical rules or principles within the Self-Model's ethical framework (e.g., `Rule_Refinement_Via_RL`, `Case_Based_Reasoning_Update`, `Direct_Instruction_Overwrite`).
    *   **`Source_Feedback`**: The type of feedback that triggers updates (e.g., `EthicalAdherenceScore_Changes`, `Explicit_Correction_From_Supervisor`, `Observed_Societal_Norm_Violation_In_Data`).
    *   **`Target_Module_Component`**: The specific part of the Self-Model or LTM where ethical knowledge is stored and updated.
*   **`Catastrophic_Forgetting_Mitigation`**: Specifies conceptual strategies to prevent new learning from erasing previously learned knowledge (e.g., `Rehearsal_Of_Core_Skills`, `Elastic_Weight_Consolidation_Conceptual`, `Generative_Replay`).
*   **`Transfer_Learning_Focus`**: Guides how the agent attempts to apply knowledge learned in one context to new situations (e.g., `Prioritize_Structurally_Similar_Tasks`, `Focus_On_Abstract_Principles_Learned`).

These parameters allow for tailoring the agent's learning processes to specific roles, tasks, and developmental objectives, enabling it to become more adaptive, knowledgeable, and ethically aligned over time.
