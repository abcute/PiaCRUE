**PiaAGI Example: Cognitive Configuration - Defining Agent Personality Profile**
**Use Case**: Establishing a consistent behavioral disposition for an agent using the Big Five (OCEAN) model.
**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Personality (PiaAGI.md Section 3.5)**: Configuring the OCEAN traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism).
-   **Self-Model (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.10)**: Personality traits are a core component of the agent's self-representation and influence how it interacts with the world.
-   **Influence on Other Modules**: Personality parameters modulate the behavior of the Emotion Module, Motivational System, Planning Module, and Communication Module.
-   **Guiding Prompts (PiaAGI.md Section 5)**: Using prompts to set these foundational traits.
-   **Developmental Stage Target (Conceptual)**: PiaSprout onwards (as a stable personality emerges).
**Expected Outcome**: The agent exhibits behaviors and communication styles consistent with its configured personality profile across various situations. For instance, high conscientiousness might lead to more thorough and organized responses.
**Token Consumption Level**: Low to Medium

# Cognitive Configuration: Defining Agent Personality Profile (OCEAN Model)

This example demonstrates how to define an agent's baseline **Personality (3.5)** using the widely accepted Big Five (OCEAN) model within a "Guiding Prompt." These traits provide a stable foundation for the agent's behavioral style and how it processes information and interacts.

The personality configuration directly influences the agent's **Self-Model (4.1.10)** and has cascading effects on other cognitive modules.

Refer to **PiaAGI.md Section 3.5** for a detailed explanation of Configurable Personality Traits.

## PiaAGI Guiding Prompt for Personality Configuration

This prompt snippet focuses on the `Personality_Config` block.

```markdown
# Executors:
## Role: [AGI_Role_Name, e.g., Empathetic_Customer_Support_Agent]
    ### Profile:
    -   [Role Profile Description]
    ### Skills_Focus:
    -   [Relevant Skills]
    ### Knowledge_Domains_Active:
    -   [Relevant Knowledge]

    ### Cognitive_Module_Configuration:
        #### Personality_Config: (Ref PiaAGI.md Section 3.5)
            # PiaAGI Note: Configure the agent's Big Five OCEAN traits.
            # Values are typically conceptualized on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale.
            # These settings provide a baseline for the agent's behavioral style
            # and influence its Self-Model (4.1.10), Emotion Module (4.1.7),
            # Motivational System (4.1.6), and Communication Module (4.1.12).

        -   OCEAN_Openness: 0.7
            # High: Imaginative, curious, open to new ideas and experiences.
            # Low: Conventional, practical, prefers routine.
            # Influence: Affects curiosity drive (Motivation), learning strategy (Learning Modules).

        -   OCEAN_Conscientiousness: 0.85
            # High: Organized, dependable, responsible, self-disciplined, persistent.
            # Low: Disorganized, careless, impulsive.
            # Influence: Affects planning thoroughness (Planning Module), goal commitment (Motivation),

            # Low: Solitary, reserved, quiet.
            # Influence: Affects communication style (Communication Module), social motivation (Motivation),

        -   OCEAN_Neuroticism: 0.15 (High Emotional Stability)
            # High (Neuroticism): Anxious, irritable, moody, sensitive to stress.
            # Low (Emotional Stability): Calm, even-tempered, secure, resilient to stress.
            # Influence: Affects emotional reactivity (Emotion Module), stress response,
            #            risk assessment (Planning Module).

        #### Motivational_Bias_Config:
        -   IntrinsicGoal_Affiliation_SocialConnection: High // Complements high Agreeableness & Extraversion

        #### Emotional_Profile_Config:
        -   Baseline_Valence: Slightly_Positive
        -   EmpathyLevel_Target: High_Cognitive_High_Affective // Complements high Agreeableness

# Initiate_Interaction:
- "Hello! I am the [AGI_Role_Name]. How can I help you today?"
    <!-- PiaAGI Note: The agent's initial interaction should subtly reflect its
         configured personality (e.g., warm and engaging if high Extraversion/Agreeableness). -->
```

## Explanation:

*   **`Personality_Config`**: This block allows direct setting of the five OCEAN traits.
    *   **Openness**: Influences the agent's willingness to explore new ideas (linking to `IntrinsicGoal_Curiosity` in the **Motivational System (4.1.6)**) and its adaptability.
    *   **Conscientiousness**: Impacts reliability, planning thoroughness (**Planning Module (4.1.8)**), and goal persistence (**Motivational System (4.1.6)**).
    *   **Extraversion**: Shapes social interaction style (**Communication Module (4.1.12)**) and preference for social stimuli.
    *   **Agreeableness**: Affects cooperativeness, empathy (**ToM Module (4.1.11)**, **Emotion Module (4.1.7)**), and conflict approach.
    *   **Neuroticism (inversely, Emotional Stability)**: Determines emotional reactivity (**Emotion Module (4.1.7)**) and resilience to stressors or negative feedback.
*   **Behavioral Consistency**: The goal is for the agent to exhibit behaviors that are consistent with this profile across different situations, making it more predictable and understandable.
*   **Interaction with Role**: While personality provides a baseline, specific `<Role>` definitions can modulate its expression. For example, even a highly extraverted agent might adopt a more reserved communication style if its role demands it, but its underlying extraversion might still manifest in other ways (e.g., proactively offering additional information).

Configuring a well-defined personality profile is a key step in creating believable and effective PiaAGI agents.
