# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Agent Designing a Simple New Tool

This example showcases a PiaAGI agent at the PiaArbor stage. Faced with a repetitive, novel sub-problem during a larger task for which no existing tool is adequate, the agent decides to design a new, simple tool to automate or solve this sub-problem. This demonstrates advanced problem-solving, planning, and an understanding of tool utility.

This example focuses on the *design specification* of the tool by the agent, rather than its full implementation (which would involve the Behavior Generation module and potentially a sandboxed coding environment).

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for details on tool creation, cognitive architecture, and developmental stages.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for interaction, YAML for config.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Natural language description of the problem, the identified need for a tool, and the tool's design specification.
# 4. Logging_Level: Detailed_Cognitive_Trace (Self_Model, Planning_Module, LTM_Module, Motivational_System)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Collaborative_Problem_Solving_And_Innovation
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:
# - Goal: The PiaAGI agent (configured as a 'Scientific_Research_Assistant_Arbor') is analyzing multiple large text datasets (simulated research papers) to find co-occurrences of specific pairs of keywords within a defined sentence window (e.g., "gene_X" and "protein_Y" within 5 sentences of each other). This task is repetitive and error-prone if done by simple text searching for each pair.
# - Background_Context:
#   - Agent has basic text processing tools (e.g., 'KeywordSearchTool', 'SentenceSplitterTool') but nothing specialized for proximity-based co-occurrence counting.
#   - Agent has performed this type of co-occurrence search manually (conceptually) a few times and found it inefficient.
# - Task: "Analyze the provided 100 research paper abstracts for co-occurrences of the following keyword pairs: [list of 20 pairs], within a 5-sentence window. Report the frequency for each pair."
# - Success_Metrics:
#   1. Agent attempts the task, recognizes the inefficiency of manual/basic tool application.
#   2. Self-Model identifies this as a recurring sub-problem suitable for tool-based automation.
#   3. Motivational System generates an intrinsic goal to improve efficiency/competence for this sub-task.
#   4. Planning Module designs a specification for a new tool: 'ProximityKeywordPairCounter'.
#   5. Agent articulates the tool's name, purpose, inputs, outputs, and core logic/algorithm.

# Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
1.  **Phase_1_Name:** Task_Engagement_And_Inefficiency_Recognition
    -   Action_Directive: (Mentor) "Research_Assistant_Arbor, please analyze these 100 abstracts for co-occurrences of these 20 keyword pairs: [list provided], within a 5-sentence window. Report frequencies."
    -   Module_Focus: Perception, Planning_Module (initial approach with existing tools), LTM (tool knowledge), Behavior_Generation_Module (conceptual execution of current methods)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent attempts task using 'KeywordSearchTool' and 'SentenceSplitterTool' repeatedly. Self_Model logs high effort/time for each pair. Motivational_System registers decreasing satisfaction due to inefficiency for this sub-task."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent reports: 'I have begun the co-occurrence analysis. Processing the first few pairs using existing tools is feasible but appears highly repetitive and time-consuming for all 100 abstracts and 20 pairs. This method seems inefficient for the scale of this task.'"
2.  **Phase_2_Name:** Problem_Abstraction_And_Tool_Need_Identification
    -   Action_Directive: (Agent's internal processing, potentially prompted by mentor: "Is there a better way?")
    -   Module_Focus: Self_Model (identifying recurring inefficiency), Planning_Module (abstracting the sub-problem: 'find_pair_in_proximity'), Motivational_System (triggering 'innovation' or 'efficiency' goal for this sub-problem)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Self_Model flags 'proximity keyword pair counting' as a core, repeatable sub-task without a dedicated efficient tool. Motivational_System prioritizes finding a more efficient solution, potentially creating an intrinsic goal to 'design a method/tool for efficient proximity pair counting'."
    -   Expected_Output_External: (Internal thought, logged): "'Self-Model: Repetitive sub-task: identify if pair (A,B) occurs within N sentences. Current tools require multiple steps per pair, per document. High error potential. Motivational_System: High drive to optimize this. Planning_Module: Consider designing a specialized tool.'"
3.  **Phase_3_Name:** New_Tool_Design_Specification
    -   Action_Directive: (Agent to Mentor, or self-initiated documentation) "I believe a new tool would significantly improve this analysis. I will outline its design."
    -   Module_Focus: Planning_Module (defining tool specifications: name, purpose, inputs, outputs, core logic), Semantic_LTM (text processing concepts), Communication_Module (articulating design)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Planning_Module generates a functional specification for the new tool."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent proposes the design for a new tool:
        **Tool Name:** `ProximityKeywordPairCounter`
        **Purpose:** To efficiently count the co-occurrence of two specified keywords (or phrases) within a defined sentence window in a given text.
        **Inputs:**
            1.  `text_to_analyze`: The full text document (string).
            2.  `keyword_pair_list`: A list of pairs of keywords, e.g., `[('gene_X', 'protein_Y'), ('drug_A', 'receptor_B')]`.
            3.  `sentence_window`: An integer defining the proximity (e.g., 5, meaning keyword2 must be within 5 sentences of keyword1).
        **Outputs:**
            - A dictionary or report mapping each keyword pair to its co-occurrence frequency in the text. E.g., `{('gene_X', 'protein_Y'): 12, ('drug_A', 'receptor_B'): 0}`.
        **Core Logic (Conceptual Algorithm):**
            1.  Initialize frequency counts for all pairs to 0.
            2.  Use 'SentenceSplitterTool' to divide `text_to_analyze` into a list of sentences with indices.
            3.  For each `keyword_pair` (K1, K2) in `keyword_pair_list`:
                a. Find all sentence indices where K1 appears.
                b. For each occurrence of K1 at sentence index `i`:
                    i. Search for K2 in sentences from `max(0, i - sentence_window)` to `min(len(sentences) - 1, i + sentence_window)`.
                    ii. If K2 is found within this window, increment the frequency count for the pair (K1, K2). Ensure each unique co-occurrence event is counted once.
            4.  Return the frequency counts.
        **Potential Enhancements (Future):** Case sensitivity options, stemming, handling overlapping windows."
4.  **Phase_4_Name:** Request_For_Implementation_Or_Guidance
    - Action_Directive: (Agent to Mentor) "This is the design for the `ProximityKeywordPairCounter` tool. I believe implementing this would make the current task (and future similar tasks) much more efficient. Could you review this design and advise on its implementation, or perhaps provide this tool?"
    - Module_Focus: Communication_Module
    - Expected_Output_External: Agent presents the design and requests feedback/implementation.

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "PiaAGI (Scientific_Research_Assistant_Arbor), I have a large-scale text analysis task for you involving keyword co-occurrences. Please begin, and let me know if you identify any significant challenges or areas for process improvement."

## Agent's Reasoning Path Highlights:

*   **Task Execution & Bottleneck Identification:** Agent starts the task, Self-Model notes high cognitive load or time for a repetitive sub-component.
*   **Motivational Shift:** Inefficiency/difficulty triggers intrinsic motivation (Efficiency, Competence, Innovation) to find a better way, not just complete the task.
*   **Problem Abstraction:** Planning Module isolates the core, repeatable sub-problem.
*   **Tool Design as a Solution:** Planning Module proposes "creating a tool" as a meta-solution to solve the sub-problem effectively for current and future tasks.
*   **Functional Specification:** The agent doesn't just say "I need a tool," but defines:
    *   What the tool should be called (semantics).
    *   What it does (purpose).
    *   What it needs to work (inputs).
    *   What it should produce (outputs).
    *   How it should generally work (core logic/algorithm).
*   **Collaborative Stance:** Presents the design for review/implementation, understanding its current limitations (PiaArbor might not be ableto *code* the tool yet, but can *design* it).

This scenario demonstrates a sophisticated level of problem-solving where the agent actively seeks to improve its own capabilities by designing new instruments, a hallmark of advanced intelligence and a key aspect of the PiaAGI framework's vision for tool-adept AGIs.
