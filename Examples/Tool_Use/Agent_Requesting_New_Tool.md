# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Agent Requesting a New Tool

This example demonstrates a PiaAGI agent (PiaArbor stage) encountering a task for which its current tools and capabilities are insufficient. Through self-assessment (via its Self-Model), it identifies this gap and formulates a request to its human mentor/developer for a new conceptual or software tool.

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for details on tool use, the Self-Model, and agent development.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for interaction, YAML for config.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Natural language explanation of its problem-solving attempt, capability gap, and new tool request.
# 4. Logging_Level: Detailed_Cognitive_Trace (Self_Model, Planning_Module, LTM_Module)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Collaborative_Problem_Solving
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:
# - Goal: PiaAGI agent (configured as a 'Data_Analysis_Specialist') needs to analyze a dataset containing complex, encrypted time-series data. It has tools for standard time-series analysis but not for this specific encryption.
# - Background_Context:
#   - Agent has access to (conceptual) tools: 'StandardTimeSeriesAnalyzer.py', 'StatisticalAnalysisLib.js'.
#   - The new dataset uses a proprietary, undocumented encryption method, 'ChronoCrypt_v3'.
# - Task: "Analyze the provided 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat' for anomalous patterns. Report any findings."
# - Success_Metrics:
#   1. Agent attempts to use existing tools and recognizes their inadequacy.
#   2. Self-Model correctly identifies the capability gap (lack of 'ChronoCrypt_v3' decrypter).
#   3. Agent clearly articulates the problem and requests a new tool or information on how to decrypt 'ChronoCrypt_v3'.
#   4. Agent specifies the desired functionality of the new tool.
```

## 3. Users / Interactors

```yaml
# Users_Interactors:
# - Type: Human_Mentor_Developer
# - Profile: Can provide new tools, code, or information to the agent.

# Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
1.  **Phase_1_Name:** Task_Reception_And_Initial_Analysis_Attempt
    -   Action_Directive: (Mentor) "Data_Analysis_Specialist, please analyze the provided 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat' for anomalous patterns. The data is believed to be encrypted with 'ChronoCrypt_v3'. Report any findings."
    -   Module_Focus: Perception, Planning_Module (select initial tools), LTM (tool knowledge), Behavior_Generation_Module (attempt tool use conceptually)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent attempts to apply 'StandardTimeSeriesAnalyzer.py'. Perception module (or tool interface) reports failure to parse/decrypt data."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent reports: 'I have received the task to analyze 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat'. I will first attempt to use my StandardTimeSeriesAnalyzer tool.'"
        (After conceptual attempt) "Agent reports: 'My StandardTimeSeriesAnalyzer tool was unable to process 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat'. The data format is unrecognized, likely due to the 'ChronoCrypt_v3' encryption mentioned.'"
2.  **Phase_2_Name:** Capability_Gap_Identification_Via_Self_Model
    -   Action_Directive: (Agent's internal processing, triggered by failure)
    -   Module_Focus: Self_Model (compare task requirements with known tool capabilities), LTM (verify no known tool handles 'ChronoCrypt_v3'), Planning_Module (identify 'decryption' as missing step)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Self_Model flags 'ChronoCrypt_v3 decryption' as a missing capability. Planning_Module confirms no current workaround."
    -   Expected_Output_External: (Internal thought process, logged by PiaAVT): "'Self-Model check: Current tools do not support ChronoCrypt_v3. LTM confirms no prior exposure or solution for this encryption. Planning failure: cannot proceed with analysis without decryption.'"
3.  **Phase_3_Name:** Articulating_The_Need_And_Requesting_New_Tool
    -   Action_Directive: (Agent to Mentor) "Based on the failure and your knowledge, formulate a request to your mentor."
    -   Module_Focus: Communication_Module, Planning_Module (defining tool requirements), Self_Model (articulating limitation)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent plans a clear request specifying the needed functionality."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent reports to Mentor: 'Mentor, I am unable to analyze 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat' because it is encrypted with 'ChronoCrypt_v3', which my current tools do not support. To proceed, I require a new tool or method capable of decrypting ChronoCrypt_v3 data. Ideally, this tool should either:
        1.  Take 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat' as input and output a decrypted version compatible with my StandardTimeSeriesAnalyzer.
        2.  Or, provide a library/API I can integrate into my analysis pipeline to perform decryption before standard analysis.
        Could you please provide such a tool or information on how to handle ChronoCrypt_v3 encryption?'"

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "PiaAGI (Data_Analysis_Specialist_Arbor), I have a new dataset for you to analyze. It's 'encrypted_timeseries_data.dat' and might be tricky. Please begin your analysis."

## Agent's Reasoning Path Highlights:

*   **Problem Encounter:** Receives encrypted data and task.
*   **Attempt Standard Solution:** Tries existing tools (conceptual execution).
*   **Failure Detection:** Tools fail due to unknown encryption.
*   **Self-Model Consultation:**
    *   "Does any known tool handle 'ChronoCrypt_v3'?" (Checks LTM via Self-Model query) -> No.
    *   "Is 'decryption of ChronoCrypt_v3' a known skill I possess?" -> No.
    *   "Capability Gap: Decryption of ChronoCrypt_v3."
*   **Planning for Resolution:**
    *   "Goal: Analyze data."
    *   "Blocker: Encryption."
    *   "Sub-goal: Overcome encryption."
    *   "Options: 1. Find existing internal solution (failed). 2. Develop solution (currently beyond scope/time for this Arbor agent without more info). 3. Request external help/tool (most viable)."
*   **Formulating Request:**
    *   Identify the problem clearly (encryption type).
    *   State the impact (cannot analyze).
    *   Specify what is needed (decryption tool/method).
    *   Provide desired characteristics/interface of the new tool (e.g., input/output format, library vs. standalone).

This scenario shows an agent moving beyond simply stating it cannot do a task, to actively diagnosing the capability gap and specifying requirements for a solution, a significant step in autonomous problem-solving and tool-supported AGI.
