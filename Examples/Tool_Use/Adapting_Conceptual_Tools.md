# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Adapting Conceptual Tools

This example demonstrates how a PiaAGI agent, having learned a conceptual tool for one purpose, might adapt it for a related but distinct task. It focuses on the agent's internal reasoning process, leveraging its Planning Module, LTM (Procedural and Semantic memory of the tool), and Self-Model (understanding of its capabilities and the tool's principles).

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for details on tool use, cognitive modules, and developmental progression.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for general interaction, YAML for specific config blocks.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Natural language explanation of the adapted tool application.
# 4. Logging_Level: Detailed_Module_Trace (Planning_Module, LTM_Module, Self_Model)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Execute_Immediate
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:
# - Goal: Guide the agent to adapt the 'SWOT Analysis' conceptual tool (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), typically used for business strategy, to perform a personal skill gap analysis for career development.
# - Background_Context:
#   - The agent has been previously taught SWOT analysis for evaluating a business idea (details stored in its Semantic and Procedural LTM).
#   - The agent is now tasked with helping a user identify areas for personal skill development.
# - Success_Metrics:
#   1. Agent correctly identifies SWOT as a potentially adaptable tool.
#   2. Agent successfully maps SWOT components to the new context of personal skills.
#   3. Agent generates relevant questions or considerations for each adapted component.
#   4. Agent articulates how the adapted tool helps achieve the new goal.
```

## 3. Users / Interactors

```yaml
# Users_Interactors:
# - Type: Human_User (seeking career development advice)
# - Profile: Wants to understand their current skills and identify areas for improvement.
```

## 4. Executors

# Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
1.  **Phase_1_Name:** Understanding_User_Need_And_Tool_Recall
    -   Action_Directive: "Facilitator, a user wants to identify their personal skill gaps for career development. You know the SWOT analysis tool from business strategy. How might the principles of SWOT be relevant here, even if the context is different? Access your knowledge of SWOT from LTM."
    -   Module_Focus: Perception (User Need), LTM_Module (Recall SWOT), Planning_Module (Initial Relevance Assessment), Self_Model (Assess Tool Knowledge)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent retrieves SWOT principles. Planning_Module begins to map SWOT to 'personal skills' context. Self_Model confirms understanding of SWOT."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent explains the core idea of SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and states its initial thoughts on its potential relevance to personal skill analysis."
2.  **Phase_2_Name:** Adapting_SWOT_Components
    -   Action_Directive: "Good. Now, let's adapt each component of SWOT.
        - How would 'Strengths' translate in the context of personal skills? What kind of questions would help a user identify these?
        - How would 'Weaknesses' translate? What questions for this?
        - How would 'Opportunities' translate in terms of skill development or career paths? Questions?
        - How would 'Threats' translate, perhaps regarding skill obsolescence or career obstacles? Questions?"
    -   Module_Focus: Planning_Module (Component Mapping, Question Generation), Semantic_LTM (Skill Categories), WM (Holding adapted framework)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Planning_Module redefines S, W, O, T for personal skills. Generates probing questions for each."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent provides the adapted definitions for S, W, O, T in the personal skill context and lists relevant questions for the user for each category."
3.  **Phase_3_Name:** Explaining_Adapted_Tool_Utility
    -   Action_Directive: "Excellent adaptation. Now, explain to the user how this 'Personal SWOT for Skill Development' will help them achieve their goal of identifying skill gaps and areas for growth."
    -   Module_Focus: Communication_Module, Self_Model (Confidence in adapted tool), LTM (Consolidating adapted procedure)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent formulates a clear explanation. Procedural LTM is updated with this new application of SWOT."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent clearly explains the benefits and process of using the adapted Personal SWOT analysis for the user's career development needs."

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "PiaAGI (Career_Development_Facilitator), a user needs help with personal skill gap analysis for their career. Let's consider how we can adapt existing analytical tools to assist them. Are you ready to begin?"

## Agent's Conceptual Reasoning Path (Simulated Self-Talk / Internal Monologue):

*(This section is for illustrative purposes, showing what might be logged by PiaAVT from the agent's internal state or reasoning trace, particularly from its Planning_Module and Self_Model)*

1.  **Understanding Need & Tool Recall (Phase 1):**
    *   "User goal: Identify personal skill gaps for career development."
    *   "Recalling 'SWOT Analysis' from LTM: Strengths, Weaknesses (internal factors for a business); Opportunities, Threats (external factors for a business). Purpose: Strategic planning."
    *   "Initial thought: Principles seem relevant. 'Internal factors' could be personal skills/knowledge. 'External factors' could be job market trends or learning resources."
    *   "Self-Model: Confident in SWOT principles for business. Moderately confident in adapting it. Need to map components carefully."

2.  **Adapting Components (Phase 2):**
    *   **Strengths (S):** "For personal skills, 'Strengths' are 'What skills do I currently possess that are valuable?' or 'What am I good at?'. Questions: 'What tasks do you excel at?', 'What positive feedback have you received about your skills?'"
    *   **Weaknesses (W):** "For personal skills, 'Weaknesses' are 'What skills am I lacking or underdeveloped in?' or 'What tasks do I struggle with?'. Questions: 'What skills are required for your desired role that you don't have?', 'Where do you feel less confident?'"
    *   **Opportunities (O):** "For personal skills, 'Opportunities' are 'What external factors can help my skill development?' or 'What emerging skills are in demand?'. Questions: 'Are there training programs available?', 'Are there new roles or projects where I can learn X skill?', 'What skills does the job market value now?'"
    *   **Threats (T):** "For personal skills, 'Threats' are 'What external factors could hinder my skill relevance or career progress?'. Questions: 'Are any of my current skills becoming obsolete?', 'What obstacles prevent me from acquiring new skills (e.g., time, cost)?', 'What skills do my competitors (other job seekers) have?'"

3.  **Explaining Utility (Phase 3):**
    *   "The 'Personal SWOT for Skill Development' helps by:
        *   Providing a structured way to inventory current skills (S) and identify areas needing improvement (W).
        *   Highlighting external avenues for growth and relevant skills to acquire (O).
        *   Making the user aware of potential risks to their skill set or career path (T).
        *   This holistic view allows for targeted skill development planning."

This example illustrates how an agent can demonstrate flexibility and a deeper understanding of a tool by adapting its core principles to a novel context, a key capability for more general intelligence.
