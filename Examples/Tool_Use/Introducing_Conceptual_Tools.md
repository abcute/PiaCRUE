**PiaAGI Example: Initiating Tool Use - Introducing a Conceptual Tool**
**Use Case**: Guiding an agent to understand and "use" a simple conceptual tool, like a problem-solving checklist, to structure its thinking for a task.
**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Tool Creation and Use (PiaAGI.md Section 3.6)**: Focus on understanding and applying a predefined conceptual tool.
-   **Procedural LTM (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.3)**: The agent learns the steps of using the tool.
-   **Working Memory (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.2)**: Holds the tool's structure and current task information during application.
-   **Planning and Decision-Making Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.8)**: Uses the tool to guide its problem-solving process.
-   **Self-Model (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.10)**: Agent becomes aware of the tool and its utility.
-   **Guiding Prompts & Developmental Scaffolding (PiaAGI.md Section 5, 5.4)**
-   **Developmental Stage Target (Conceptual)**: PiaSapling (capable of following structured procedures and understanding abstract tools).
**Expected Outcome**: The agent successfully applies the steps of the conceptual tool to solve a given problem, demonstrating an understanding of its structure and purpose. Its Self-Model incorporates the tool as a known problem-solving strategy.
**Token Consumption Level**: Medium

# Initiating Tool Use: Introducing a Conceptual Problem-Solving Checklist

This example demonstrates how to introduce a simple **conceptual tool** – a problem-solving checklist – to a PiaAGI agent (e.g., PiaSapling stage). The goal is for the agent to learn the tool's structure and apply it to a task, thereby incorporating it into its **Procedural LTM (4.1.3)** and making its problem-solving process more explicit and structured via its **Planning Module (4.1.8)**.

See **PiaAGI.md Section 3.6** for the importance of Tool Creation and Use.

## PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Introducing the "5 Whys" Checklist

The "5 Whys" is a simple iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.

## Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
    <!--
        PiaAGI Note: This curriculum targets Procedural LTM (4.1.3) for tool steps,
        WM (4.1.2) for active application, Planning (4.1.8) for execution,
        and Self-Model (4.1.10) for recognizing the tool's utility.
        Learning Modules (4.1.5) facilitate internalization.
    -->
1.  **Tool_Introduction_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Today, we will learn a conceptual tool called the '5 Whys'. It's a method to find the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking 'Why?'. Here's how it works:
        1.  State the problem clearly.
        2.  Ask 'Why?' the problem is occurring. Write down the answer.
        3.  If that answer doesn't directly identify the root cause, ask 'Why?' about that answer.
        4.  Repeat step 3 until the root cause is identified, typically by the fifth 'Why?'
        Do you understand the structure of the '5 Whys' tool?"
    *   Agent_Task: "Acknowledge understanding or ask clarifying questions about the tool's structure."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: Agent stores tool structure in Semantic/Procedural LTM (4.1.3). -->

2.  **Guided_Application_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Problem_Statement: "Let's apply this. Problem: The website checkout page is failing for some users."
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Now, using the '5 Whys' tool, let's analyze this problem. Start with the first 'Why'."
    *   Agent_Task_Why1: "Ask 'Why is the website checkout page failing for some users?' and provide a plausible answer."
    *   Expected_Agent_Output_Why1: "Why 1: Why is the website checkout page failing for some users? Answer 1: [Agent's plausible answer, e.g., 'Perhaps there's a payment processing error.']"
    *   Trainer_Feedback_Why1: (If needed, guide the agent's answer or confirm it's plausible).
    *   Agent_Task_Why2: "Now, based on your Answer 1, ask the second 'Why?'"
    *   Expected_Agent_Output_Why2: "Why 2: Why might there be a payment processing error? Answer 2: [Agent's plausible answer, e.g., 'Maybe the payment gateway API is down.']"
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Continue this process for three more 'Whys', or until you believe you've reached a fundamental root cause."

3.  **Independent_Application_Phase (Test)**:
    *   Trainer_New_Problem: "Problem: Employee morale has been low recently."
    *   Agent_Task: "Analyze this new problem using the full '5 Whys' method. Show each 'Why' and your corresponding 'Answer'."
    *   Expected_Output_Internal: Agent uses its Planning Module (4.1.8), guided by the '5 Whys' procedure in its Procedural LTM (4.1.3), to systematically break down the problem.
    *   Trainer_Evaluation: "Assess the agent's application of the tool for logical consistency and depth of analysis."

4.  **Tool_Utility_Reflection_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "How did using the '5 Whys' tool help in analyzing these problems?"
    *   Agent_Task: "Reflect on the utility of the '5 Whys' tool."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: This encourages the Self-Model (4.1.10) to recognize the tool's value,
             increasing the likelihood of its future use. -->

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "Analytical Problem Solver Trainee, today we're going to learn a new conceptual tool for problem analysis. Are you ready to begin?"
```

## Explanation:

*   **Conceptual Tool**: The "5 Whys" is not a physical tool but a structured method for thinking. This is a key aspect of advanced tool use for AGI.
*   **Explicit Instruction**: The trainer explicitly teaches the steps of the tool. The agent's **Learning Modules (4.1.5)** and **Semantic/Procedural LTM (4.1.3)** are engaged to store this knowledge.
*   **Guided Application**: The agent first uses the tool with guidance, allowing the trainer to provide feedback and reinforce correct application. This helps solidify the procedure in **Procedural LTM (4.1.3)**.
*   **Independent Application**: The agent then applies the tool to a new problem, demonstrating its understanding and ability to use its **Planning Module (4.1.8)** in conjunction with the learned tool.
*   **Reflection**: The agent is asked to reflect on the tool's utility. This encourages the **Self-Model (4.1.10)** to recognize the value of the tool, making it more likely to be selected autonomously in future problem-solving contexts.
*   **Developmental Appropriateness**: This type of task is suitable for a PiaSapling stage agent that has developed basic reasoning and the ability to follow multi-step procedures.

This example shows how an agent can be taught to use abstract, conceptual tools to improve its cognitive processing, a crucial step towards more general problem-solving abilities.
