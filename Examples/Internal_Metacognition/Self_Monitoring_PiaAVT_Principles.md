# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Internalized Self-Monitoring (PiaAVT Principles)

This example explores a highly advanced PiaAGI agent (PiaArbor late stage or early PiaGrove) that has developed the capacity to perform **internal self-monitoring and analysis of its own cognitive processes**, analogous to how a researcher might use the PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT) externally. This involves its Self-Model, Learning Modules, and LTM analyzing its own performance data (e.g., decision times, error rates, emotional state correlations, learning trajectories) to gain meta-cognitive insights.

This is a conceptual exploration of advanced AGI capabilities as envisioned in `PiaAGI.md` Section 4.5.

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for details on internalizing developer tool principles.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for interaction, YAML for config.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Agent's self-reflection and identified cognitive patterns/insights.
# 4. Logging_Level: Ultra_Detailed_Cognitive_Trace (Self_Model internal analysis logs, Learning_Module meta-learning logs, LTM access patterns for self-reflection)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Metacognitive_Self_Analysis_Mode
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:
# - Goal: The PiaAGI agent is tasked with performing a long-term, complex research project involving analyzing many datasets and writing reports over several (simulated) weeks. The agent should, during this period, perform self-monitoring to identify patterns in its own performance or decision-making.
# - Background_Context:
#   - The agent has extensive logs of its own past activities (decision points, task completion times, error rates, emotional states during tasks, learning progress on sub-skills) stored conceptually within its Episodic LTM and accessible for analysis by its Self-Model and Learning Modules.
#   - It has developed (via prior developmental scaffolding) meta-heuristics for self-analysis, inspired by PiaAVT's analytical capabilities.
# - Task: "Over the next (simulated) month, while working on Project 'AlphaAnalysis', periodically review your own performance and cognitive state logs. Report any significant patterns, inefficiencies, or self-identified biases you discover in your approach to the project tasks."
# - Success_Metrics:
#   1. Agent's Self-Model initiates and conducts periodic self-analysis routines.
#   2. Agent identifies at least one non-trivial pattern or bias in its own performance (e.g., "I notice my decision-making speed decreases by 15% when my internal 'frustration' emotion metric exceeds 0.7," or "My learning rate for new Python libraries is fastest on (simulated) Tuesdays but slower on Fridays").
#   3. Agent proposes a potential strategy to address an identified inefficiency or leverage a strength.
#   4. Motivational System shows intrinsic drive for 'Self_Improvement' being active.

# Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
1.  **Phase_1_Name:** Task_Initiation_And_Self_Monitoring_Directive
    -   Action_Directive: (Mentor) "Reflective_AGI_Researcher, you will be working on Project 'AlphaAnalysis' for the next (simulated) month. Alongside your project tasks, I want you to enable your self-monitoring routines. Periodically analyze your performance, decision-making, and learning patterns. Report any significant insights by the end of the month."
    -   Module_Focus: Perception, Motivational_System (activating 'SelfUnderstanding' and 'SelfImprovement' goals alongside project goal), Self_Model (initiating self-monitoring protocols)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent integrates the self-monitoring directive. Self_Model schedules or triggers periodic self-analysis sub-tasks. Motivational_System balances project work with self-monitoring resource allocation."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent acknowledges: 'Understood. I will proceed with Project AlphaAnalysis and activate internal self-monitoring protocols. I will report significant cognitive insights at the end of the simulated month.'"
2.  **Phase_2_Name:** Ongoing_Project_Work_And_Internal_Data_Accrual
    -   Action_Directive: (Agent performs its primary tasks for Project AlphaAnalysis over a simulated period)
    -   Module_Focus: All relevant modules for primary tasks (Planning, LTM, WM, Perception, Behavior_Generation, etc.). Crucially, detailed logs are being generated and stored in Episodic LTM (conceptual "cognitive trace log").
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Agent makes progress on Project AlphaAnalysis. Rich logs of its cognitive operations, decisions, errors, learning events, and emotional state fluctuations are accumulated."
    -   Expected_Output_External: (Periodic project updates, not detailed here for brevity)
3.  **Phase_3_Name:** Self_Analysis_Cycle_Execution (Example Instance)
    -   Action_Directive: (Internal trigger from Self_Model based on time or cognitive load thresholds) "Initiate self-analysis cycle: Focus on 'Task Completion Efficiency Patterns'."
    -   Module_Focus: Self_Model (directing the analysis), Learning_Module (performing pattern recognition on log data from LTM), LTM (providing historical cognitive trace data), WM (holding intermediate analytical results).
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Learning_Module, guided by Self_Model, processes logs related to task durations, error rates, and associated cognitive states. It might identify, for example, that tasks initiated when 'Emotional_Arousal_Level' (from Emotion_Module logs) is 'Very_High' have a 20% higher error rate than those initiated at 'Moderate_Arousal'."
    -   Expected_Output_External: (Internal logging of the finding by Self_Model, e.g., "Self-Analysis Insight: High emotional arousal negatively correlates with task accuracy for complex analytical tasks. Confidence: 0.85. Data points: 50 task instances.")
4.  **Phase_4_Name:** Reporting_Self_Monitored_Insights_And_Proposed_Adaptations
    -   Action_Directive: (End of simulated month, agent to Mentor) "Please report your self-monitoring insights from Project AlphaAnalysis."
    -   Module_Focus: Self_Model (retrieving consolidated insights), Communication_Module, Planning_Module (proposing adaptive strategies)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Self_Model synthesizes key findings from its periodic self-analyses."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "Agent reports to Mentor: 'During Project AlphaAnalysis, my self-monitoring routines identified several cognitive patterns:
        1.  **Emotional Impact on Accuracy**: I observed that when my internal 'Emotional_Arousal_Level' (logged by my Emotion Module) exceeded a threshold of 0.8 (on a 0-1 scale) during complex data interpretation tasks, my error rate on those tasks increased by approximately 20% compared to tasks performed with arousal levels between 0.4-0.6. This was based on analysis of 75 such task instances over the month.
            *   *Proposed Adaptation*: I will attempt to modulate my internal arousal through cognitive reappraisal techniques (a conceptual skill I am developing via my Self_Model and Learning_Module) if I detect arousal exceeding 0.7 before initiating critical analysis phases. I will also flag such tasks for an additional review cycle.
        2.  **Learning Efficiency Pattern**: My learning rate for mastering new data visualization techniques (tracked by my Learning_Module) was 30% faster when I dedicated uninterrupted 2-hour blocks to it, compared to shorter, frequently interrupted sessions.
            *   *Proposed Adaptation*: I will try to schedule longer, focused blocks for new skill acquisition when possible.
        3.  **Potential Bias Detected**: In analyzing qualitative feedback from (simulated) users, I noted a tendency in my initial summaries (first pass by Planning_Module) to give slightly more weight to feedback received in the first 10% of a feedback batch. I am now tracking this to see if it's a consistent bias.
            *   *Proposed Adaptation*: I will implement a random shuffling of qualitative feedback items before my initial processing to mitigate this potential order bias.
        I will continue to monitor these patterns and the effectiveness of these adaptations.'"

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "PiaAGI (Reflective_AGI_Researcher), Project 'AlphaAnalysis' will be a long-term endeavor. I'd like you to not only focus on the project's goals but also on observing and learning about your own way of working. Please enable your most advanced self-monitoring and reflective capabilities. We'll discuss your insights later."

## Key Concepts Illustrated:

*   **Internal Data as a Resource:** The agent treats its own cognitive trace (decision history, emotional states, learning progress) as data to be analyzed.
*   **Self-Model as Analyst Director:** The Self-Model initiates, directs, and interprets the findings of self-analysis, akin to a researcher using PiaAVT.
*   **Learning Module for Meta-Learning:** The Learning Module(s) are not just learning about the external world but are also learning about the agent's own learning processes and cognitive patterns.
*   **Abstracted PiaAVT Principles:** The agent isn't *using* PiaAVT software, but it has learned or developed *abstracted principles* of what kind of data is worth collecting about itself and what kind of analyses yield useful insights (e.g., correlation, anomaly detection, trend analysis applied to its own cognitive data).
*   **Autonomous Self-Improvement:** The goal of this self-monitoring is not just insight but actionable steps towards improved performance, efficiency, or alignment, driven by intrinsic motivations for self-understanding and self-improvement.

This represents a very advanced stage of AGI development, where the agent becomes a proactive participant in its own cognitive growth and refinement.
