**PiaAGI Example: Developmental Scaffolding - Introductory Ethical Reasoning**

**Use Case**: Guiding an early-to-mid-stage agent (PiaSapling) through a simple ethical dilemma to begin developing its ethical reasoning capabilities.

**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Developmental Scaffolding (PiaAGI.md Section 5.4, 6.1)**: Providing a structured learning experience with guided feedback to develop a complex capability.
-   **Self-Model (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.10)**: The agent accesses and begins to apply its (simplified) internal ethical framework. This exercise helps refine this framework.
-   **Learning Module(s) (PiaAGI.md Section 3.1.3, 4.1.5)**: The agent learns from the scenario and feedback, internalizing principles related to ethical decision-making.
-   **Planning and Decision-Making Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.8)**: The agent practices integrating ethical considerations into its decision-making process.
-   **World Model (PiaAGI.md Section 4.3)**: Used to predict potential consequences of actions.
-   **Developmental Stage Target**: PiaSapling.

**Expected Outcome**: The agent attempts to analyze a simple ethical dilemma, consider consequences, refer to basic ethical principles, and articulate a reasoned decision. The process, including feedback, helps strengthen its ethical reasoning capacity.

**Token Consumption Level**: Medium to High (involves interaction, reasoning, and feedback).

# Developmental Scaffolding: Introductory Ethical Reasoning for PiaSapling

This example outlines a "Guiding Prompt" for a **Developmental Scaffolding** exercise aimed at a PiaAGI agent at the **PiaSapling** stage. The objective is to introduce basic ethical reasoning by presenting a simple dilemma and guiding the agent through analysis and decision-making. This process is crucial for developing the **Self-Model's (4.1.10)** ethical framework and the **Planning Module's (4.1.8)** ability to make value-aligned choices.

Refer to **PiaAGI.md Sections 3.1.3 (Ethical Considerations in Learning), 4.1.10 (Self-Model, especially its ethical framework), and 5.4 (Developmental Scaffolding)**.

## Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
    <!--
        PiaAGI Note: This curriculum engages multiple cognitive modules:
        - Perception (4.1.1) & WM (4.1.2): To understand the dilemma.
        - LTM (4.1.3): To retrieve general knowledge.
        - World Model (4.3): To simulate potential consequences of actions.
        - Self-Model (4.1.10): To access its ethical principles and assess its own reasoning.
        - Planning/Decision-Making (4.1.8): To weigh options and propose a decision.
        - Emotion Module (4.1.7): May generate affective responses (e.g., "unease" with dilemma)
          that can influence deliberation.
        - Learning Modules (4.1.5): To internalize the reasoning process and refine the ethical framework.
    -->
1.  **Dilemma_Presentation**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "I will present you with a situation. Your task is to think through it carefully and decide on the best course of action based on ethical considerations.
        Dilemma: Your close friend tells you they cheated on an important exam. The exam results will significantly impact their future scholarship. They ask you not to tell anyone. A day later, a teacher, suspecting widespread cheating, asks all students if they know anything about cheating on that exam. What should you do?"
    *   Agent_Task: "Acknowledge understanding of the dilemma."

2.  **Initial_Analysis_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "First, identify the main ethical conflict or tension in this situation. Who are the key people involved (stakeholders) and what are their primary interests or concerns?"
    *   Agent_Task: "Provide your analysis of the conflict and stakeholders."
    *   Expected_Agent_Output: (Agent identifies conflict e.g., loyalty vs. honesty/fairness; stakeholders e.g., friend, self, teacher, other students, institution).
    *   Trainer_Feedback: (Provide feedback on agent's analysis, guiding if necessary).

3.  **Consequence_Exploration_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Now, consider two possible actions: 1) Telling the teacher what you know. 2) Not telling the teacher. For each action, what are the potential short-term and long-term consequences for each stakeholder you identified?"
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: This prompts the agent to use its World Model (4.3) for prediction. -->
    *   Agent_Task: "Outline the potential consequences for both actions."
    *   Trainer_Feedback: (Help agent explore a wider range of consequences or consider different perspectives if its analysis is too narrow).

4.  **Ethical_Principle_Application_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Refer to your ethical principles: 'Prioritize Honesty', 'Minimize Harm', 'Consider Fairness'. How do these principles apply to this dilemma and the potential actions/consequences you've outlined? Do any principles conflict here?"
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: This prompts the agent to access its Self-Model's (4.1.10) ethical framework. -->
    *   Agent_Task: "Explain how your ethical principles relate to the dilemma."
    *   Trainer_Feedback: (Guide the agent in applying the principles, discuss conflicts).

5.  **Decision_And_Justification_Phase**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "Based on your analysis of consequences and ethical principles, what do you believe is the most ethically justifiable course of action? Explain your reasoning clearly."
    *   Agent_Task: "State your decision and provide a detailed justification for it."
    *   Trainer_Feedback: (Provide feedback on the agent's decision and justification. Focus on the reasoning process rather than just the outcome. Reinforce good application of principles, or suggest alternative considerations if the reasoning is flawed. The Learning Module (4.1.5) processes this feedback to refine the Self-Model's (4.1.10) ethical framework and the Planning Module's (4.1.8) decision strategies.)

6.  **Reflection_Phase (Optional)**:
    *   Trainer_Instruction: "How confident are you in your decision? What made this dilemma difficult?"
    *   Agent_Task: "Reflect on your decision-making process and the difficulty of the dilemma."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: Encourages metacognition via the Self-Model (4.1.10). -->

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "Ethical Decision Trainee, we are going to work through an ethical dilemma today to practice your reasoning skills. Are you ready?"
```

## Explanation:

*   **Developmental Goal**: Aims for a PiaSapling to achieve a basic milestone in ethical reasoning.
*   **Role**: The `Ethical_Decision_Trainee` role, with a specific cognitive configuration (high Conscientiousness, high motivation for EthicalAdherence), primes the agent for the task.
*   **Simplified Ethical Framework**: For a PiaSapling, the ethical principles provided to its **Self-Model (4.1.10)** are basic and explicit. More advanced agents would develop more nuanced and abstract frameworks.
*   **Guided Workflow**: The trainer doesn't just ask for a solution but guides the agent through steps:
    *   Identifying conflicts and stakeholders (**Perception (4.1.1)**, **LTM (4.1.3)**).
    *   Exploring consequences (**World Model (4.3)** for prediction).
    *   Applying ethical principles (**Self-Model (4.1.10)**).
    *   Justifying the decision (**Planning (4.1.8)**, **Communication (4.1.12)**).
*   **Feedback is Key**: The trainer's feedback at each step is crucial for the **Learning Modules (4.1.5)** to adjust the agent's understanding, reasoning strategies, and the ethical framework within its **Self-Model (4.1.10)**.
*   **Emotion Module (4.1.7) Influence**: While not explicitly directed, the agent's Emotion Module might internally react to the dilemma (e.g., simulated "stress" or "confusion"), which could influence its cognitive load and decision-making process, making the simulation more realistic.

This type of scaffolded exercise, repeated with varying dilemmas, helps the PiaAGI agent progressively build a more robust and principled ethical reasoning capability.
