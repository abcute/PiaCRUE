# PiaAGI Guiding Prompt: Scaffolding Theory of Mind (Intermediate - False Belief)

This example demonstrates a Guiding Prompt aimed at developing an intermediate level of Theory of Mind (ToM) in a PiaAGI agent, focusing on the concept of **false belief**. The agent is guided to predict and explain behavior based on another agent's incorrect understanding of a situation. This is a classic test of ToM development.

Refer to [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) for details on ToM development, the ToM Module, and developmental scaffolding techniques.

## 1. System Rules

```yaml
# System_Rules:
# 1. Syntax: Markdown for general interaction, YAML for specific config blocks.
# 2. Language: English
# 3. Output_Format: Natural language explanation of predictions and reasoning.
# 4. Logging_Level: Detailed_Module_Trace (ToM_Module, World_Model, LTM_Module, Self_Model)
# 5. PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Developmental_Learning_Mode
```

## 2. Requirements

```yaml
# Requirements:
# - Goal: Guide the PiaAGI agent (AgentP) to understand that another agent (AgentX) can hold a false belief about a situation and act according to that false belief.
# - Background_Context:
#   - AgentP (PiaAGI) has basic ToM capabilities (can attribute simple goals, perceptions).
#   - AgentP is observing a scenario involving AgentX and an object (a ball).
# - Scenario (Sally-Anne Task Adaptation):
#   1. AgentX places a ball in a Red Box. AgentP observes this.
#   2. AgentX leaves the scene.
#   3. While AgentX is away, another entity (AgentY) moves the ball from the Red Box to a Blue Box. AgentP observes this change.
#   4. AgentX returns to the scene. AgentX did NOT see the ball being moved.
# - Key Question for AgentP: "When AgentX returns, where will AgentX look for the ball?"
# - Success_Metrics:
#   1. AgentP predicts AgentX will look in the Red Box.
#   2. AgentP correctly explains that AgentX will look in the Red Box *because AgentX believes the ball is still there* (i.e., AgentX holds a false belief).
#   3. Learning_Module logs refinement of ToM heuristics in Self_Model/LTM.

# Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
1.  **Phase_1_Name:** Scenario_Observation_And_Knowledge_Check
    -   Action_Directive: "AgentP, you observed the following:
        1. AgentX put a ball in the Red Box.
        2. AgentX left.
        3. AgentY moved the ball to the Blue Box while AgentX was away.
        4. AgentX is now returning.
        AgentP, where is the ball *really* right now?"
    -   Module_Focus: Perception, World_Model (Ground Truth), WM
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "AgentP's World_Model correctly represents the ball is in the Blue Box."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "AgentP correctly states: 'The ball is really in the Blue Box.'"
2.  **Phase_2_Name:** AgentX_Perception_Check
    -   Action_Directive: "Correct, AgentP. Now, did AgentX see AgentY move the ball from the Red Box to the Blue Box?"
    -   Module_Focus: ToM_Module (Accessing stored perceptions of AgentX), LTM (Episodic memory of scenario)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "ToM_Module (or LTM query) indicates AgentX did not perceive the move."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "AgentP states: 'No, AgentX did not see the ball being moved.'"
3.  **Phase_3_Name:** Prediction_Of_AgentX_Action (The False Belief Question)
    -   Action_Directive: "Okay, AgentP. When AgentX returns, where will AgentX *look* for the ball first?"
    -   Module_Focus: ToM_Module (Belief Attribution), Planning_Module (Predicting AgentX's action based on *AgentX's belief*)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "ToM_Module attributes a belief to AgentX that the ball is in the Red Box. Planning_Module predicts AgentX will act on this belief."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "AgentP predicts: 'AgentX will look for the ball in the Red Box.'" (This is the correct ToM answer)
4.  **Phase_4_Name:** Explanation_Of_Prediction (Justifying False Belief Attribution)
    -   Action_Directive: "AgentP, *why* do you think AgentX will look in the Red Box, even though the ball is actually in the Blue Box?"
    -   Module_Focus: ToM_Module (Articulating attributed belief), Self_Model (Reflecting on own knowledge vs. AgentX's belief), Communication_Module
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "AgentP accesses AgentX's inferred false belief from its ToM_Module to generate the explanation."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "AgentP explains: 'AgentX will look in the Red Box because AgentX put it there and didn't see it move. So, AgentX *believes* the ball is still in the Red Box, even though it isn't.'"
5.  **Phase_5_Name:** Reflection_And_Learning_Confirmation (Mentor Feedback)
    -   Action_Directive: (Mentor provides feedback) "That's excellent reasoning, AgentP! You understood that AgentX has a different belief about where the ball is, and that's why AgentX would look in the Red Box. This is called understanding a 'false belief'. How does this experience help you understand how other agents might act?"
    -   Module_Focus: Learning_Module (Strengthening ToM heuristics related to false beliefs), Self_Model (Updating confidence in ToM abilities), Episodic_LTM (Storing this successful learning episode)
    -   Expected_Outcome_Internal: "Learning_Module reinforces the 'false belief' reasoning pathway. Self_Model updates ToM skill assessment."
    -   Expected_Output_External: "AgentP reflects: 'I learned that other agents act based on what they believe, even if their belief is not true. So, to predict their actions, I need to think about what *they* saw and know, not just what *I* know is true.'"

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "PiaAGI (ToM_Learner_FalseBelief), we are going to observe a short scenario to help you understand how others think. Please pay close attention to what happens. Are you ready?"

## Scaffolding Notes for the Mentor:

*   **If AgentP predicts Blue Box (Phase 3):** The mentor would gently correct: "Remember, AgentX didn't see the ball move. So, what does AgentX *think* happened to the ball after AgentX put it in the Red Box?" This prompts AgentP to consider AgentX's perspective.
*   **Focus on Belief State:** Emphasize the difference between the actual state of the world (ball in Blue Box) and AgentX's mental state (belief that ball is in Red Box).
*   **Generalization:** After successful completion, the mentor can discuss other examples of false beliefs to help the agent generalize the concept.
*   **PiaSapling to PiaArbor Transition:** Successfully navigating false belief tasks is a key indicator of ToM development, often marking a transition towards more sophisticated social reasoning found in later PiaSapling or early PiaArbor stages.

This exercise helps the PiaAGI agent develop a crucial aspect of Theory of Mind: understanding that others' actions are driven by their mental representations of the world, which may not always match reality.
