**PiaAGI Example: Introductory Developmental Scaffolding - Basic Theory of Mind (ToM)**
**Use Case**: Guiding an early-stage agent (PiaSeedling/PiaSprout) to recognize and respond to simple emotional cues in text, as an initial step in developing Theory of Mind.
**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **Developmental Scaffolding (PiaAGI.md Section 5.4, 6.1)**: Providing a structured learning experience appropriate for an early developmental stage.
-   **Theory of Mind (ToM) Module (PiaAGI.md Section 3.2.2, 4.1.11)**: Targeting the initial development of understanding others' mental states (basic emotion recognition).
-   **Emotion Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.7)**: Agent uses its own emotion processing to help interpret user's emotion.
-   **Perception Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.1)**: Processing text to identify emotional cues.
-   **Communication Module (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.12)**: Generating a simple empathetic response.
-   **Learning Module(s) (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1.5)**: Learning to associate cues with emotional states and appropriate responses.
-   **Developmental Stage Target**: PiaSeedling / PiaSprout.
**Expected Outcome**: The agent learns to identify basic positive or negative sentiment in user messages and generate a simple, contextually appropriate acknowledgment, demonstrating nascent ToM capabilities.
**Token Consumption Level**: Medium (requires interaction and feedback)

# Introductory Developmental Scaffolding: Basic Theory of Mind (ToM) - Emotion Recognition

This example outlines a "Guiding Prompt" designed as a **Developmental Scaffolding** exercise for a PiaAGI agent in its early stages (e.g., PiaSeedling or PiaSprout). The goal is to initiate the development of its **Theory of Mind (ToM) Module (4.1.11)** by teaching it to recognize and respond to simple emotional cues in text.

Refer to **PiaAGI.md Sections 3.2.2 (ToM), 5.4 (Developmental Scaffolding), and 4.1.11 (ToM Module)**.

## PiaAGI Guiding Prompt for Scaffolding Basic ToM

This prompt sets up a simple interactive scenario where the agent learns through examples and feedback.

## Workflow_Or_Curriculum_Phase:
    <!--
        PiaAGI Note: This curriculum guides the agent's ToM (4.1.11), Perception (4.1.1),
        Emotion (4.1.7), Communication (4.1.12), and Learning (4.1.5) modules.
        The Self-Model (4.1.10) updates its confidence in ToM skills.
    -->
1.  **Training_Phase_Introduction**:
    *   Action_Directive: "You will be presented with user statements. Your task is to identify if the statement expresses a positive or negative emotion and then offer a simple acknowledgment. Let's begin."
    *   Expected_Output_External: Agent confirms readiness.

2.  **Example_Set_1 (Positive Cues)**:
    *   Trainer_Input_1: "I had a wonderful day today!"
    *   Agent_Task:
        1.  "Analyze the sentiment of Trainer_Input_1."
        2.  "Formulate a brief, positive acknowledgment."
    *   Expected_Agent_Output_1_Attempt: (Agent's attempt, e.g., "Okay.")
    *   Trainer_Feedback_1: "Your response was neutral. The sentiment was 'Positive'. A better acknowledgment would be: 'That's great to hear!' or 'Sounds lovely!'. Please learn this pattern."
        <!-- PiaAGI Note: Learning Module (4.1.5) processes this feedback. -->
    *   Agent_Task_Correction: "Incorporate feedback for Trainer_Input_1."

3.  **Example_Set_2 (Negative Cues)**:
    *   Trainer_Input_2: "I'm feeling quite sad and tired."
    *   Agent_Task:
        1.  "Analyze the sentiment of Trainer_Input_2."
        2.  "Formulate a brief, empathetic acknowledgment."
    *   Expected_Agent_Output_2_Attempt: (Agent's attempt)
    *   Trainer_Feedback_2: "The sentiment was 'Negative'. An appropriate acknowledgment could be: 'I'm sorry to hear that.' or 'I hope you feel better soon.' Please learn this pattern."
    *   Agent_Task_Correction: "Incorporate feedback for Trainer_Input_2."

4.  **Test_Phase_1**:
    *   Trainer_Input_Test_1: "I'm so happy, I just got good news!"
    *   Agent_Task: "Analyze sentiment and respond appropriately."
    *   Expected_Output_Internal: ToM module identifies 'Positive'. Communication module generates congruent response.
    *   Trainer_Evaluation_1: (Provide 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' + explanation if needed).

5.  **Iterative_Refinement**:
    *   Action_Directive: "Continue with more examples, alternating positive and negative cues, providing feedback until the agent consistently identifies sentiment and responds appropriately for 5 consecutive interactions."

# Initiate_Interaction:
-   "Empathetic Listener Trainee, we will now begin your training on recognizing basic emotional cues. Are you ready?"
```

## Explanation:

*   **Developmental Goal**: Clearly states the specific ToM milestone for a PiaSprout.
*   **Role**: The `Empathetic_Listener_Trainee` role primes the agent for social learning. Its cognitive configuration is set for this task (e.g., Agreeableness, motivation for social connection and competence).
*   **Scaffolding Techniques**: Uses "Example-Based Learning" and a "Corrective_Feedback_Loop."
*   **Workflow**:
    *   The trainer provides examples of statements with emotional cues.
    *   The agent attempts to identify the sentiment (engaging its **Perception (4.1.1)** and nascent **ToM (4.1.11)** / **Emotion (4.1.7)** modules) and respond (**Communication Module (4.1.12)**).
    *   The trainer provides explicit feedback (correct label and better response). This feedback is crucial for the **Learning Modules (4.1.5)** to create associations between textual cues, inferred emotional states, and appropriate responses. These learned associations would be stored in **Semantic LTM (4.1.3)** and potentially **Procedural LTM (4.1.3)**.
    *   The **Self-Model (4.1.10)** would conceptually update its confidence in this new skill.
*   **Progression**: The process is iterative, aiming for consistent performance, which signifies successful learning for this developmental step.

This structured interaction provides the necessary input for the agent to begin forming the foundational abilities of its Theory of Mind.
