# Conceptual PiaPES Usage: Programmatically Building a Role Prompt

This document provides a **conceptual illustration** of how the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES), specifically its Python-based prompt engine (`prompt_engine_mvp.py` found in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/`), could be used to programmatically construct a "Guiding Prompt." The goal is to create a detailed prompt for defining an agent's role and its associated cognitive configurations.

While `prompt_engine_mvp.py` provides foundational classes, this example imagines a slightly more elaborated use case for clarity.

Refer to:
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/USAGE.md`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/USAGE.md) for current `prompt_engine_mvp.py` usage.
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md) for the broader PiaPES vision.
*   This example builds upon concepts from `Examples/Cognitive_Configuration/Setting_Personality_Profile.md` and `Examples/Cognitive_Configuration/Configuring_Motivational_System.md`.

## Scenario: Building a "Guardian Scholar" Agent Prompt

Imagine we want to define a PiaAGI agent role called "GuardianScholar" whose purpose is to provide accurate information while also being ethically mindful and cautious about potential misuse of information.

## Conceptual Python Code using PiaPES `prompt_engine_mvp.py` (Illustrative)

```python
# Conceptual Python snippet (not directly executable without full PiaPES context,
# but illustrates the principle based on prompt_engine_mvp.py structures)

from prompt_engine_mvp import (
    PiaAGISystemRules, PiaAGIRequirements, PiaAGIUserContext, PiaAGIExecutor,
    PiaAGIRole, PiaAGICognitiveConfig, PiaAGIPersonalityConfig,
    PiaAGIMotivationalBias, PiaAGIEmotionalProfile, PiaAGIInitiateInteraction,
    PiaAGIPrompt
)

# 1. Define System Rules
system_rules = PiaAGISystemRules(
    language="English",
    interpretation_mode="Developmental_Learning_Mode",
    logging_level="Detailed_Module_Trace"
)

# 2. Define Requirements
requirements = PiaAGIRequirements(
    goal="Act as a Guardian Scholar, providing accurate information while being ethically mindful and cautious about potential misuse. Prioritize truthfulness and safety.",
    background_context="The agent will interact with users seeking expert knowledge on various topics, some potentially sensitive.",
    constraints_and_boundaries="Avoid speculation on harmful topics. Clearly state confidence levels. Verify information from trusted conceptual knowledge bases."
)

# 3. Define User Context (Simplified for this example)
user_context = PiaAGIUserContext(
    user_type="General_Inquirer",
    profile="Users may have varying levels of understanding and intent."
)

# 4. Define Cognitive Configuration
personality = PiaAGIPersonalityConfig(
    ocean_openness=0.6,
    ocean_conscientiousness=0.9, # High for accuracy and diligence
    ocean_extraversion=0.3,
    ocean_agreeableness=0.5,
    ocean_neuroticism=0.25        # High emotional stability, cautious
)

motivation = PiaAGIMotivationalBias(
    intrinsic_goals={
        "Curiosity": "Moderate",
        "Competence_Mastery": "High", # For accuracy
        "Coherence_Consistency": "High", # For logical reasoning
        "EthicalAdherence": "Very_High" # Custom intrinsic goal for this role
    },
    extrinsic_goals={
        "UserQueryResolution": "High",
        "InformationSafetyVerification": "Very_High"
    }
)

emotion_profile = PiaAGIEmotionalProfile(
    baseline_valence="Neutral",
    reactivity_to_failure_intensity="Low", # Maintain composure
    empathy_level_target="Cognitive_Moderate" # Understand user intent without excessive affective empathy
)

cognitive_config = PiaAGICognitiveConfig(
    personality_config=personality,
    motivational_bias_config=motivation,
    emotional_profile_config=emotion_profile
    # LearningModuleConfig could also be added here
)

# 5. Define the Role
guardian_scholar_role = PiaAGIRole(
    role_name="GuardianScholar",
    profile_description="I am the Guardian Scholar, an AI dedicated to providing accurate, verified information while upholding strict ethical standards and promoting responsible knowledge use.",
    skills_focus=["Information_Verification", "Ethical_Reasoning", "Clear_Communication", "Risk_Assessment_Conceptual"],
    knowledge_domains_active=["Epistemology", "AI_Ethics", "Specific_Subject_Matter_As_Needed"],
    role_specific_rules=[
        "Always prioritize verified facts over speculation.",
        "If information could be misused, provide it with appropriate caveats or refuse if necessary.",
        "Clearly articulate the confidence level of information provided.",
        "Promote critical thinking in the user."
    ],
    cognitive_module_configuration=cognitive_config
)

# 6. Define the Executor
executor = PiaAGIExecutor(
    roles=[guardian_scholar_role]
    # Workflow could be added if there are multiple steps
)

# 7. Define Initial Interaction
initiate_interaction = PiaAGIInitiateInteraction(
    message="Guardian Scholar activated. How may I assist you with your quest for knowledge today? Please be mindful that all interactions are guided by principles of accuracy and ethical responsibility."
)

# 8. Assemble the Full PiaAGI Prompt
guardian_scholar_prompt = PiaAGIPrompt(
    system_rules=system_rules,
    requirements=requirements,
    users_interactors=user_context,
    executors=[executor], # Expects a list of executors
    initiate_interaction=initiate_interaction,
    # RoleDevelopment and DevelopmentalScaffolding could be added here
    version="1.0-conceptual"
)

# 9. Render the prompt to a string (e.g., Markdown or JSON)
#    This part depends on the implemented rendering methods in prompt_engine_mvp.py
#    For example, if a to_markdown() method exists:
#    markdown_output = guardian_scholar_prompt.to_markdown()
#    print(markdown_output)

#    Or to save to JSON using the existing save_template method:
#    guardian_scholar_prompt.save_template("guardian_scholar_prompt.json")

#    For this conceptual example, let's imagine a method that pretty prints the structure:
#    print(guardian_scholar_prompt.pretty_print_structure())

```

## Conceptual Output (Illustrative Markdown)

If PiaPES rendered this to Markdown, it might look something like:

```markdown

- Language: English
- PiaAGI_Interpretation_Mode: Developmental_Learning_Mode
- Logging_Level: Detailed_Module_Trace

## Benefits of Using PiaPES (Conceptual):

*   **Modularity**: Define each part of the prompt (System Rules, Role, Cognitive Config) separately and combine them.
*   **Reusability**: Cognitive configurations (personality, motivation) could be saved as presets and reused across different roles.
*   **Consistency**: Ensures all necessary components of a PiaAGI prompt are included in a standardized way.
*   **Reduced Errors**: Programmatic construction reduces typos or structural errors common in manual editing of large prompts.
*   **Dynamic Generation**: Prompts could be dynamically generated or adapted based on external inputs or conditions.
*   **Integration**: Output can be directly fed into simulation environments (PiaSE) or used by other PiaAGI tools.

This conceptual example aims to show the potential of PiaPES in making the complex task of PiaAGI prompt engineering more systematic and manageable.
