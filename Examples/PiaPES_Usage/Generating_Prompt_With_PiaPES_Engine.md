**PiaAGI Example: PiaPES Usage - Programmatically Generating a Guiding Prompt**

**Use Case**: Demonstrating how the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES) Python prompt engine (`prompt_engine_mvp.py`) can be used to programmatically construct and serialize a complex PiaAGI Guiding Prompt.

**PiaAGI Concepts Illustrated**:
-   **PiaPES (PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/prompt_engine_mvp.py)**: Practical application of the MVP prompt templating engine.
-   **Programmatic Prompt Construction**: Building prompts using Python classes for modularity, reusability, and consistency.
-   **Guiding Prompts (PiaAGI.md Section 5)**: Assembling the full structure of a Guiding Prompt for agent configuration.
-   **Cognitive Module Configuration (PiaAGI.md Section 4.1)**: Defining elements like Role, Self-Model, Personality, and Motivation through code.
-   **Serialization**: Saving the constructed prompt object to a JSON file.

**Expected Outcome**: A clear Python script demonstrating the instantiation and assembly of various PiaPES classes to create a complete `PiaAGIPrompt` object, and then saving it to a JSON file. This showcases a more robust and maintainable approach to prompt engineering than manual text editing for complex prompts.

**Token Consumption Level**: N/A (Focus is on the tool usage to generate a prompt, not the direct execution of the generated prompt itself in this example).

# PiaPES Usage: Programmatically Generating a Guiding Prompt

This example provides a concrete illustration of how to use the Python classes from the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite's MVP engine (`prompt_engine_mvp.py`, located in `PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/`) to programmatically build a detailed "Guiding Prompt." This approach is particularly useful for complex prompts involving extensive cognitive configuration.

This example will construct a prompt similar in structure to the "Junior Research Analyst" role previously detailed in `Examples/RoleDevelopment.md`.

Refer to:
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/USAGE.md`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/USAGE.md) for instructions on the `prompt_engine_mvp.py` classes.
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md) for the broader PiaPES vision.

## Benefits Demonstrated:

*   **Modularity & Reusability**: Each component (System Rules, Role, Cognitive Config) is an object. Cognitive configurations could be defined once and reused across multiple roles or prompts.
*   **Type Safety (Conceptual)**: Using Python classes helps catch errors earlier if parameters are misspelled or have incorrect types (though `prompt_engine_mvp.py` uses `Optional[Any]`, future versions could be stricter with type hints).
*   **Maintainability**: Changing a part of the prompt (e.g., updating a skill in a role) is a targeted code change, less prone to errors than manually editing a large text block.
*   **Dynamic Generation**: Prompts can be customized or assembled dynamically based on different inputs or conditions within a larger Python application.
*   **Standardization**: Ensures prompts adhere to the defined PiaAGI structure.

This example shows how PiaPES aims to elevate prompt engineering from a craft to a more systematic and software-driven discipline, essential for managing the complexity of AGI development.
