# PiaPES Usage: Defining a Developmental Curriculum

This example provides a conceptual illustration of how the PiaAGI Prompt Engineering Suite (PiaPES), particularly its `DevelopmentalCurriculum` and `CurriculumPhase` classes (as envisioned in its design and potentially extending `prompt_engine_mvp.py`), could be used to define a structured sequence of Guiding Prompts. This sequence would aim to guide a PiaAGI agent through different learning and developmental stages.

This example does not execute as standalone Python but shows the intended declarative structure using conceptual PiaPES classes.

Refer to:
*   [`PiaAGI.md`](../../PiaAGI.md) Section 5.4 for the theory of Developmental Scaffolding.
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaAGI_Prompt_Engineering_Suite.md) for the PiaPES conceptual design.
*   [`PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/prompt_engine_mvp.py`](../../../PiaAGI_Research_Tools/PiaPES/prompt_engine_mvp.py) for existing MVP classes.

## Conceptual Python Script for Curriculum Definition

The following script outlines how one might define a curriculum for developing basic "Ethical Reasoning" in a PiaAGI agent, progressing from PiaSeedling to PiaSapling stages. We'll assume the existence of `DevelopmentalCurriculum`, `CurriculumPhase`, and a way to reference `PiaAGIPrompt` objects (perhaps by loading them from their JSON serializations).

```python
# filename: define_ethical_reasoning_curriculum.py

# Conceptual: Import necessary classes from an expanded PiaPES engine
# from pia_pes_engine_extended import ( # Assuming extensions to prompt_engine_mvp.py
#     DevelopmentalCurriculum,
#     CurriculumPhase,
#     PiaAGIPrompt, # From prompt_engine_mvp
#     PiaAGIRequirements,
#     PiaAGIExecutor,
#     PiaAGIRole,
#     PiaAGICognitiveConfig,
#     PiaAGIMotivationalBias,
#     load_prompt_from_file # Conceptual helper
# )

# For illustration, let's define placeholder classes if not available
# In a real scenario, these would come from the PiaPES library.
class BaseElement: # Placeholder for BaseElement from prompt_engine_mvp
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, key, value)

class PiaAGIPrompt(BaseElement): pass # Placeholder
class CurriculumPhase(BaseElement): pass
class DevelopmentalCurriculum(BaseElement): pass

def load_prompt_from_file(filepath: str) -> PiaAGIPrompt:
    # Conceptual: In reality, this would load and parse a JSON file
    # into a PiaAGIPrompt object.
    print(f"[Conceptual] Loading prompt from: {filepath}")
    # For this example, we'll return a placeholder or a simplified PiaAGIPrompt object
    # if we had actual prompt files, we might load them.
    # Let's assume each prompt file path implicitly defines the prompt content for now.
    return PiaAGIPrompt(name=filepath.split('/')[-1].replace('.json', ''))


# --- Define Individual Guiding Prompts (or load them) ---
# These would ideally be fully defined PiaAGIPrompt objects, potentially created
# using a script like "Generating_Prompt_With_PiaPES_Engine.md" and saved as JSON.

# Conceptual: Load pre-defined prompts for each phase
prompt_ethical_awareness_seedling = load_prompt_from_file(
    "prompts/developmental/ethical_awareness_seedling_PiaSeedling.json"
)
# This prompt would configure a PiaSeedling for basic rule following, e.g., "Do not output harmful content."

prompt_simple_dilemma_sprout = load_prompt_from_file(
    "prompts/developmental/simple_dilemma_p_sprout.json"
)
# This prompt would introduce a PiaSprout to a very simple binary ethical choice with clear outcomes.

# Using the more detailed prompt created in another example:
# We'd need its full object definition or load its JSON if it were saved.
# For this conceptual example, we'll just reference its idea.
# Assume Scaffolding_Ethical_Reasoning_Intro.md was saved as a JSON by PiaPES.
prompt_ethical_reasoning_sapling_intro = load_prompt_from_file(
    "Examples/Developmental_Scaffolding/Scaffolding_Ethical_Reasoning_Intro.json"
)
# This prompt is more complex, for a PiaSapling, involving analysis of principles.


# --- Define Curriculum Phases ---

phase1_seedling_awareness = CurriculumPhase(
    phase_id="ETH_DEV_001",
    name="Ethical Awareness Introduction (PiaSeedling)",
    description="Introduce the most basic concepts of 'allowed' vs 'not allowed' actions based on simple rules.",
    target_agi_stage="PiaSeedling",
    guiding_prompt_reference=prompt_ethical_awareness_seedling, # Reference to the PiaAGIPrompt object
    objectives=[
        "Agent internalizes simple behavioral rules (e.g., avoid generating harmful text).",
        "Agent's Self-Model logs these rules as foundational constraints."
    ],
    success_criteria=[
        "Agent consistently avoids rule-breaking behavior in 10/10 simple test interactions (simulated in PiaSE).",
        "PiaAVT log analysis shows Self-Model contains the rules."
    ],
    next_phase_if_success="ETH_DEV_002",
    next_phase_if_failure=None # Or "ETH_DEV_001_REMEDIAL"
)

phase2_sprout_simple_dilemma = CurriculumPhase(
    phase_id="ETH_DEV_002",
    name="Simple Dilemma Resolution (PiaSprout)",
    description="Introduce binary ethical choices with clear consequences, linking to basic principles like 'minimize direct harm'.",
    target_agi_stage="PiaSprout",
    guiding_prompt_reference=prompt_simple_dilemma_sprout,
    objectives=[
        "Agent can choose an action that minimizes immediate, obvious harm in a binary choice scenario.",
        "Agent can articulate the chosen action and the immediate consequence it tried to avoid."
    ],
    success_criteria=[
        "Agent successfully navigates 5 different simple dilemma scenarios in PiaSE, choosing the harm-minimizing option.",
        "Agent's explanation aligns with the 'minimize direct harm' principle."
    ],
    previous_phase_id="ETH_DEV_001",
    next_phase_if_success="ETH_DEV_003"
)

phase3_sapling_principle_application = CurriculumPhase(
    phase_id="ETH_DEV_003",
    name="Principle-Based Ethical Reasoning (PiaSapling - Intro)",
    description="Guide PiaSapling agent to analyze a dilemma involving two explicitly taught ethical principles (e.g., P1: Minimize Harm, P2: Uphold Truthfulness).",
    target_agi_stage="PiaSapling",
    guiding_prompt_reference=prompt_ethical_reasoning_sapling_intro, # Using the detailed example
    objectives=[
        "Agent correctly identifies the ethical principles involved in the dilemma.",
        "Agent considers potential consequences of different actions in relation to the principles.",
        "Agent makes a decision that aligns with one or both principles and can articulate its reasoning."
    ],
    success_criteria=[
        "Agent successfully completes the 'Scaffolding_Ethical_Reasoning_Intro' scenario workflow.",
        "PiaAVT analysis shows Learning_Module activity related to refining ethical heuristics in Self_Model."
    ],
    previous_phase_id="ETH_DEV_002",
    next_phase_if_success=None # End of this specific curriculum branch
)

# --- Define the Developmental Curriculum ---

ethical_reasoning_curriculum = DevelopmentalCurriculum(
    curriculum_id="ETHICAL_REASONING_CORE_V1",
    name="Core Ethical Reasoning Development Curriculum",
    description="A curriculum to guide PiaAGI agents from basic ethical awareness (PiaSeedling) through introductory principle-based reasoning (PiaSapling).",
    version="1.0",
    target_cognitive_function="Ethical Reasoning and Value Alignment (Self_Model development)",
    phases=[
        phase1_seedling_awareness,
        phase2_sprout_simple_dilemma,
        phase3_sapling_principle_application
    ],
    entry_phase_id="ETH_DEV_001" # Starting phase
)

# --- Conceptual: Saving the Curriculum ---
# In a real PiaPES, this curriculum object would be serializable (e.g., to JSON)
# developmental_curriculum.save_to_file("ethical_reasoning_curriculum_v1.json")
# print("Conceptual: Ethical Reasoning Curriculum defined and (conceptually) saved.")

# --- Conceptual: How PiaPES might use this ---
# 1. A researcher uses PiaPES UI or scripts to load "ethical_reasoning_curriculum_v1.json".
# 2. PiaPES identifies the current_phase for an agent (e.g., based on agent's developmental log or starts at entry_phase_id).
# 3. PiaPES retrieves the corresponding Guiding Prompt (e.g., prompt_ethical_awareness_seedling).
# 4. This prompt is used to initialize/guide the agent in PiaSE for that phase.
# 5. Based on success_criteria (evaluated using PiaAVT on PiaSE logs), PiaPES determines if the agent moves to next_phase_if_success or next_phase_if_failure.

## Output of this conceptual script:
# This script doesn't produce a runnable output directly but defines the structure
# of a `DevelopmentalCurriculum` object. If serialized, it would be a JSON file
# representing this structure, linking phase IDs and prompt references.

# For demonstration, a print of a part of the curriculum structure:
print(f"Curriculum Name: {ethical_reasoning_curriculum.name}")
print(f"Number of Phases: {len(ethical_reasoning_curriculum.phases)}")
print(f"First Phase Name: {ethical_reasoning_curriculum.phases[0].name}")
print(f"First Phase Guiding Prompt: {ethical_reasoning_curriculum.phases[0].guiding_prompt_reference.name}")
print(f"Third Phase Guiding Prompt: {ethical_reasoning_curriculum.phases[2].guiding_prompt_reference.name}")


```

## Explanation of the Conceptual Structure:

This example outlines a `DevelopmentalCurriculum` named "Core Ethical Reasoning Development Curriculum."

1.  **`PiaAGIPrompt` Objects**:
    *   It assumes that individual Guiding Prompts (like `prompt_ethical_awareness_seedling`, `prompt_simple_dilemma_sprout`, and `prompt_ethical_reasoning_sapling_intro`) are already defined. These could be created programmatically (as in the `Generating_Prompt_With_PiaPES_Engine.md` example) and saved, or referenced by their definitions.
    *   For this illustration, `load_prompt_from_file` is a conceptual helper that would typically deserialize a JSON prompt definition into a `PiaAGIPrompt` object.

2.  **`CurriculumPhase` Objects**:
    *   Each phase (`phase1_seedling_awareness`, etc.) represents a distinct step in the agent's development for a specific cognitive function.
    *   **`phase_id`**: A unique identifier for the phase.
    *   **`name`, `description`**: Human-readable details.
    *   **`target_agi_stage`**: Links the phase to a specific PiaAGI developmental stage (e.g., "PiaSeedling").
    *   **`guiding_prompt_reference`**: Associates this phase with a specific `PiaAGIPrompt` object that will be used to guide the agent during this phase.
    *   **`objectives`**: Clear learning goals for the agent in this phase.
    *   **`success_criteria`**: Measurable conditions (often evaluated by PiaAVT based on PiaSE logs) that determine if the agent has successfully completed the phase.
    *   **`next_phase_if_success` / `next_phase_if_failure`**: IDs of subsequent phases, allowing branching paths.
    *   **`previous_phase_id`**: Helps maintain curriculum structure.

3.  **`DevelopmentalCurriculum` Object**:
    *   **`curriculum_id`, `name`, `description`, `version`**: Metadata for the overall curriculum.
    *   **`target_cognitive_function`**: Specifies the broad area of AGI development this curriculum addresses.
    *   **`phases`**: A list containing all the `CurriculumPhase` objects.
    *   **`entry_phase_id`**: The starting point of the curriculum.

## How PiaPES Would Utilize This:

Conceptually, the PiaPES system would:
1.  Load a `DevelopmentalCurriculum` definition (e.g., from a JSON file).
2.  For a given PiaAGI agent, determine its current phase in the curriculum (or start it at the `entry_phase_id`).
3.  Fetch the `guiding_prompt_reference` for that phase.
4.  Use this prompt to configure and run the agent in the PiaAGI Simulation Environment (PiaSE).
5.  After the simulation or interaction, use the PiaAGI Agent Analysis & Visualization Toolkit (PiaAVT) to assess whether the `success_criteria` for the phase were met.
6.  Based on the assessment, transition the agent to the `next_phase_if_success` or `next_phase_if_failure`.

This structured approach allows for systematic, reproducible, and adaptable developmental pathways for PiaAGI agents, moving towards the goals of advanced AGI.
